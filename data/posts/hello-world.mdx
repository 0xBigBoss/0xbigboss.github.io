# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog powered by [One](https://onestack.dev/) and MDX!

## What is MDX?

MDX lets you write JSX in your Markdown content. You can import components, use variables, and create interactive content.

## Code Example

Here's some TypeScript:

```typescript
const greeting = (name: string): string => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greeting('World'));
```
