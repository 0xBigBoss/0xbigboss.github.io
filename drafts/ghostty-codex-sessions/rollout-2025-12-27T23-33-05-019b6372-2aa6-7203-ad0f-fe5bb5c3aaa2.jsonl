Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, tilt commands | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# AGENTS\n\nRepository overview for automated agents and contributors.\n\n## Summary\n\n`rn-playwright-driver` is a Playwright-compatible E2E test driver for React Native apps.

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"exec","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"a8a52f08e4f5e9c96eadbe4fd03628c3ec06dbe1","branch":"main"}}}

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Add to `packages/driver/src/types.ts`:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   export type WaitForState = \"attached\" | \"visible\" | \"hidden\" | \"detached\";\r\n\r\n   export interface WaitForOptions {\r\n     state?: WaitForState;\r\n     timeout?: number;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   export interface Capabilities {\r\n     viewTree: boolean;\r\n     screenshot: boolean;\r\n     lifecycle: boolean;\r\n     pointer: boolean;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   export type HarnessLoadMode = \"always\" | \"dev-only\" | \"explicit\";\r\n   ```\r\n2. Update Locator interface with new waitFor signature\r\n3. Update Device interface with capabilities\r\n4. Run `bun run check` in packages/driver\r\n\r\n## Phase 1: Harness Gating\r\n1. Create `packages/driver/harness/dev.ts`:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   // Only installs harness in dev/E2E mode\r\n   declare const __DEV__: boolean | undefined;\r\n   declare const globalThis: { __E2E__?: boolean };\r\n\r\n   if (typeof __DEV__ !== \"undefined\" && __DEV__ || globalThis.__E2E__) {\r\n     require(\"./index\");\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n2. Add exports in package.json for `./harness/dev`\r\n3. Update README.md with dev-safe usage patterns\r\n4. Run `bun run check`\r\n\r\n## Phase 2: CDP Reliability\r\n1. Add to CDPClientOptions in `packages/driver/src/cdp/client.ts`:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   autoReconnect?: boolean;\r\n   maxReconnectAttempts?: number;\r\n   reconnectBackoffMs?: number;\r\n   ```\r\n2. Implement reconnect logic with exponential backoff\r\n3. Re-enable Runtime.enable after reconnect\r\n4. Improve error messages in evaluate() to include:\r\n   - Truncated expression (first 100 chars)\r\n   - Target URL and ID\r\n5. Run `bun run check`\r\n\r\n## Phase 3: Capabilities Helper\r\n1. Add to `packages/driver/src/device.ts`:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   async capabilities(): Promise<Capabilities> {\r\n     return this.evaluate<Capabilities>(\r\n       \"globalThis.__RN_DRIVER__?.capabilities ?? { viewTree: false, screenshot: false, lifecycle: false, pointer: true }\"\r\n     );\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n2. Update harness to expose capabilities object\r\n3. Run `bun run check`\r\n\r\n## Phase 4: Locator waitFor States\r\n1. Update `packages/driver/src/locator.ts` waitFor method:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   async waitFor(options?: WaitForOptions): Promise<void> {\r\n     const state = options?.state ?? \"visible\";\r\n     const timeout = options?.timeout ?? DEFAULT_WAIT_TIMEOUT;\r\n     // Implementation for each state\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n2. Implement state logic:\r\n   - `attached`: element exists (query succeeds)\r\n   - `visible`: exists AND visible property is true\r\n   - `hidden`: exists AND visible property is false\r\n   - `detached`: element does NOT exist (query returns NOT_FOUND)\r\n3. Add E2E tests in `example/e2e/counter.spec.ts` for each state\r\n4. Run `bun run check` and E2E tests\r\n\r\n## Phase 5: View Tree Matching\r\n1. Enhance iOS `RNDriverViewTreeModule.swift`:\r\n   - Check accessibilityValue in addition to accessibilityLabel\r\n   - For container views, aggregate text from child UILabel/Text views\r\n   - Improve matchesText to handle these cases\r\n2. Enhance Android `RNDriverViewTreeModule.kt`:\r\n   - Check contentDescription and text properties\r\n   - Traverse child TextViews for container matching\r\n3. Add E2E tests that verify improved matching\r\n4. Run `bun run check`\r\n\r\n## Phase 6: Native Screenshot by Handle\r\n1. iOS `RNDriverScreenshotModule.swift`:\r\n   ```swift\r\n   AsyncFunction(\"captureElement\") { (handle: String) -> [String: Any] in\r\n     // Resolve handle from view-tree module\r\n     // Render view to UIImage\r\n     // Return base64 PNG\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n2. Android `RNDriverScreenshotModule.kt`:\r\n   ```kotlin\r\n   AsyncFunction(\"captureElement\") { handle: String ->\r\n     // Resolve handle from view-tree module\r\n     // Draw view to Bitmap\r\n     // Return base64 PNG\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n3. Add TypeScript bindings in `packages/screenshot/src/index.ts`\r\n4. Update harness bridge in `packages/driver/harness/index.ts`\r\n5. Update `Locator.screenshot()` to use native captureElement when available\r\n6. Run `bun run check`\r\n\r\n## Phase 7: Documentation\r\n1.

Document the blocking issue:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   echo \"## Blocked on Phase X\" > BLOCKED.md\r\n   echo \"Issue: [description]\" >> BLOCKED.md\r\n   echo \"Attempted: [list approaches]\" >> BLOCKED.md\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Consider phase-specific fallbacks:\r\n   - Phase 2 (CDP): Skip auto-reconnect, focus on better errors only\r\n   - Phase 5 (View tree): Defer nested text aggregation\r\n   - Phase 6 (Native screenshot): Keep JS-based region capture as fallback\r\n\r\n3. If native code (Swift/Kotlin) is blocking:\r\n   - Ensure Expo Modules API patterns match existing code\r\n   - Check for missing imports or type mismatches\r\n\r\n4. If tests fail:\r\n   - E2E tests require real device/simulator - document this\r\n   - Unit tests should pass without device\r\n\r\nOutput: <promise>BLOCKED</promise>\r\n</if_stuck>\r\n"}}
