Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, tilt commands | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# Agent Development Guide\n\nA file for [guiding coding agents](https://agents.md/).\n\n## Commands\n\n- **Build:** `zig build`\n- **Test (Zig):** `zig build test`\n- **Test filter (Zig)**: `zig build test -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- **Formatting (Zig)**: `zig fmt .`\n- **Formatting (other)**: `prettier -w .`\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n- Shared Zig core: `src/`\n- C API: `include`\n- macOS app: `macos/`\n- GTK (Linux and FreeBSD) app: `src/apprt/gtk`\n\n## libghostty-vt\n\n- Build: `zig build lib-vt`\n- Build Wasm Module: `zig build lib-vt -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding`\n- Test: `zig build test-lib-vt`\n- Test filter: `zig build test-lib-vt -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- When working on libghostty-vt, do not build the full app.\n- For C only changes, don't run the Zig tests.

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"465d284c0d1d9131443517cb0ead695089b9a6c3","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:ghostty-org/ghostty.git"}}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

When columns change (especially growing, which unwraps rows), `total_rows` can decrease while the viewport pin remains at a position that can no longer fit `rows` rows below it. If the viewport pin ends up inside the active area after this change, the pin becomes invalid but may not be clamped if the resize path doesn't include a clamp check.\r\n\r\n**Note on synchronization:** This is NOT a race condition. Renderer reads are protected by `renderer_state.mutex` (see `generic.zig:1138`) and resize writes also hold that same mutex (see `Termio.zig:472`). The renderer cannot see a partially-updated PageList.\r\n\r\n**Additional issue:** When `getTopLeft(.viewport)` returns the stale pin and `getBottomRight(.viewport)` falls back to active, the row iterator would cover fewer than `self.rows` rows, leading to rendering inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n**Sentry event_id:** `b4c31945-c3ab-4a5b-5ef8-be7b4d4e65f6`\r\n\r\n**Crash arithmetic:**\r\n- `rows = 76`, `total_rows = 116`, `viewport_pin.y = 46`\r\n- `active_top = 116 - 76 = 40`\r\n- Pin at 46 is inside active (46 >= 40)\r\n- Pin at 46 needs row `46 + 75 = 121`, but max row is 115\r\n- Result: `down()` returns null → panic\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAfter resize/reflow, the viewport pin should be clamped to a valid position that can fit `rows` rows below it. If the pin ends up inside the active area, viewport should transition to `.active` mode.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe viewport remains `.pin` with a stale position, causing `getBottomRight(.viewport)` to panic when attempting to calculate the bottom-right corner.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Have a terminal with scrollback content\r\n2. Scroll up to pin the viewport in history\r\n3. Resize the terminal (especially growing columns, which causes wrapped rows to unwrap)\r\n4. The crash occurs during the next render frame\r\n\r\n## Ghostty Logs\r\n\r\n```\r\n* thread #16, stop reason = EXC_SOFTWARE (code=65538, subcode=0x191e335b0)\r\n  * frame #0: 0x0000000191e335b0 libsystem_kernel.dylib`thread_policy_get + 396\r\n    frame #1: 0x0000000191d72850 libsystem_c.dylib`abort + 124\r\n    frame #2: 0x0000000101347070 ghostty`posix.abort at posix.zig:732:29 [opt]\r\n    frame #3: 0x0000000101346d30 ghostty`debug.defaultPanic at debug.zig:0 [opt]\r\n    frame #4: 0x0000000101346f98 ghostty`debug.FullPanic.unwrapNull at debug.zig:68:17 [opt]\r\n    frame #5: 0x00000001012321c4 ghostty`terminal.PageList.getBottomRight at PageList.zig:3980:22 [opt]\r\n    frame #6: 0x000000010125dbec ghostty`terminal.PageList.rowIterator at PageList.zig:3641:28 [opt]\r\n    frame #7: 0x00000001012b4388 ghostty`terminal.render.RenderState.update at render.zig:433:41 [opt]\r\n    frame #8: 0x00000001012b17a0 ghostty`renderer.generic.Renderer.updateFrame at generic.zig:1148:47 [opt]\r\n    frame #9: 0x0000000101292d68 ghostty`renderer.Thread.renderCallback at Thread.zig:607:27 [opt]\r\n    frame #10: 0x0000000101292d24 ghostty`renderer.Thread.wakeupCallback at Thread.zig:524:23 [opt]\r\n    frame #11: 0x0000000101290ebc ghostty`watcher.async.AsyncMachPort.callback at async.zig:350:34 [opt]\r\n    frame #12: 0x0000000101262fd8 ghostty`backend.kqueue.Loop.tick at kqueue.zig:540:42 [opt]\r\n    frame #13: 0x0000000101289d9c ghostty`backend.kqueue.Loop.run at kqueue.zig:303:62 [opt]\r\n    frame #14: 0x0000000101289d94 ghostty`renderer.Thread.threadMain_ at Thread.zig:262:26 [opt]\r\n    frame #15: 0x0000000101289a3c ghostty`renderer.Thread.threadMain at Thread.zig:201:21 [opt]\r\n    frame #16: 0x0000000101289a3c ghostty`Thread.callFn at Thread.zig:509:13 [opt]\r\n    frame #17: 0x0000000101289a3c ghostty`Thread.PosixThreadImpl.entryFn at Thread.zig:781:30 [opt]\r\n    frame #18: 0x0000000191e6dc08 libsystem_kernel.dylib\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Ghostty Version\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.3.0-main+517716898\r\nBuild mode: ReleaseSafe\r\nRenderer: metal\r\n```\r\n\r\n## OS Version\r\n\r\nmacOS 26.1.0 (build 25B78)\r\n\r\n## Minimal Config\r\n\r\nDefault configuration.

This occurs after resize/reflow when the PageList state becomes inconsistent.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n- **Release**: 1.3.0-main+517716898\r\n- **Build mode**: ReleaseSafe\r\n- **Renderer**: metal\r\n- **Thread type**: renderer\r\n- **OS**: macOS 26.1.0 (build 25B78)\r\n- **dSYM status**: matched (dSYM bundle)\r\n\r\n## Evidence\r\n- Backtrace: `lldb_bt.txt`\r\n- Event summary: `event_summary.json`\r\n\r\n## Symbolicated Stack (excerpt)\r\n\r\n```\r\nframe #4: debug.FullPanic.unwrapNull at debug.zig:68:17\r\nframe #5: PageList.getBottomRight at PageList.zig:3980:22\r\nframe #6: PageList.rowIterator at PageList.zig:3641:28\r\nframe #7: RenderState.update at render.zig:433:41\r\nframe #8: Renderer.updateFrame at generic.zig:1148:47\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Root Cause Analysis\r\n\r\nThe crash occurs at `PageList.zig:3979-3980`:\r\n\r\n```zig\r\nconst down = br.down(self.rows - 1) orelse {\r\n    br = self.getTopLeft(.active);\r\n    br = br.down(self.rows - 1).?;  // <-- PANIC HERE\r\n    br.x = br.node.data.size.cols - 1;\r\n    break :viewport br;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fallback logic added in commit `71f1a46bb` handles the case where the viewport pin can't fit `rows` rows below it. However, the fallback assumes `getTopLeft(.active)` followed by `.down(rows - 1)` will always succeed.\r\n\r\nThis assumption can fail when:\r\n1. The viewport pin is invalid (triggering the fallback)\r\n2. AND the active area itself doesn't have enough rows (if `total_rows < rows`)\r\n\r\n**Note on synchronization:** This is NOT a race condition. Renderer reads are protected by `renderer_state.mutex` (see `generic.zig:1138`) and resize writes also hold that same mutex (see `Termio.zig:472`). The renderer cannot see a partially-updated PageList.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is **viewport pin invalidation after resize/reflow**: after resizing columns (especially when cols grow and wrapped rows unwrap), `total_rows` can decrease. If the viewport pin ends up inside the active area after this change, the pin becomes invalid but may not be clamped if the resize path doesn't include a clamp check.\r\n\r\nAdditional issue: when `getTopLeft(.viewport)` returns the stale pin and `getBottomRight(.viewport)` falls back to active, the row iterator would cover fewer than `self.rows` rows, leading to rendering inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n## Suggested Fixes\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Consistent viewport validation (recommended)\r\nMake both `getTopLeft(.viewport)` and `getBottomRight(.viewport)` validate the pin and fall back to active behavior when invalid. This ensures the row iterator always gets consistent top-left and bottom-right positions.\r\n\r\n```zig\r\n// In getTopLeft:\r\n.pin => pin: {\r\n    const vp = self.viewport_pin.*;\r\n    // If the pin can't fit `rows` rows below it, fall back to active\r\n    if (vp.down(self.rows - 1) == null) {\r\n        break :pin self.getTopLeft(.active);\r\n    }\r\n    break :pin vp;\r\n},\r\n\r\n// In getBottomRight:\r\nconst down = br.down(self.rows - 1) orelse {\r\n    // Fall back to screen bottom as ultimate safety\r\n    const node = self.pages.last.?;\r\n    break :viewport .{\r\n        .node = node,\r\n        .y = node.data.size.rows - 1,\r\n        .x = node.data.size.cols - 1,\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Clamp viewport in all resize paths\r\nAdd viewport clamping to the `.gt` (cols growing) path in `resize()` to ensure the viewport pin is always valid after any resize operation.\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n- `19676195-f339-457a-3a96-0f321ca76c0b.ghosttycrash`\r\n- `439463A9-04F4-459B-9E95-CAF34877BC2B.dmp`\r\n- `4E6A8F09-18DC-4631-B913-04241DA3D343.dmp`\r\n- `REPORT.md`\r\n- `c490e5ff-7b14-4eae-0efc-e1a6c69aa495.ghosttycrash`\r\n- `dsym_uuids.txt`\r\n- `event_summary.json`\r\n- `lldb_bt.txt`\r\n"}}

Must use when reading or writing Zig files.\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Zig Best Practices\r\n\r\n## Type-First Development\r\n\r\nTypes define the contract before implementation. Follow this workflow:\r\n\r\n1. **Define data structures** - structs, unions, and error sets first\r\n2. **Define function signatures** - parameters, return types, and error unions\r\n3. **Implement to satisfy types** - let the compiler guide completeness\r\n4. **Validate at comptime** - catch invalid configurations during compilation\r\n\r\n### Make Illegal States Unrepresentable\r\n\r\nUse Zig's type system to prevent invalid states at compile time.\r\n\r\n**Tagged unions for mutually exclusive states:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: only valid combinations possible\r\nconst RequestState = union(enum) {\r\n    idle,\r\n    loading,\r\n    success: []const u8,\r\n    failure: anyerror,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn handleState(state: RequestState) void {\r\n    switch (state) {\r\n        .idle => {},\r\n        .loading => showSpinner(),\r\n        .success => |data| render(data),\r\n        .failure => |err| showError(err),\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: allows invalid combinations\r\nconst RequestState = struct {\r\n    loading: bool,\r\n    data: ?[]const u8,\r\n    err: ?anyerror,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explicit error sets for failure modes:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: documents exactly what can fail\r\nconst ParseError = error{\r\n    InvalidSyntax,\r\n    UnexpectedToken,\r\n    EndOfInput,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) ParseError!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: anyerror hides failure modes\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) anyerror!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Distinct types for domain concepts:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Prevent mixing up IDs of different types\r\nconst UserId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\nconst OrderId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\n\r\nfn getUser(id: UserId) !User {\r\n    // Compiler prevents passing OrderId here\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn createUserId(raw: u64) UserId {\r\n    return @enumFromInt(raw);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Comptime validation for invariants:**\r\n```zig\r\nfn Buffer(comptime size: usize) type {\r\n    if (size == 0) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size must be greater than 0\");\r\n    }\r\n    if (size > 1024 * 1024) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size exceeds 1MB limit\");\r\n    }\r\n    return struct {\r\n        data: [size]u8 = undefined,\r\n        len: usize = 0,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Non-exhaustive enums for extensibility:**\r\n```zig\r\n// External enum that may gain variants\r\nconst Status = enum(u8) {\r\n    active = 1,\r\n    inactive = 2,\r\n    pending = 3,\r\n    _,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn processStatus(status: Status) !void {\r\n    switch (status) {\r\n        .active => {},\r\n        .inactive => {},\r\n        .pending => {},\r\n        _ => return error.UnknownStatus,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Module Structure\r\n\r\nLarger cohesive files are idiomatic in Zig. Keep related code together: tests alongside implementation, comptime generics at file scope, public/private controlled by `pub`. Split only when a file handles genuinely separate concerns. The standard library demonstrates this pattern with files like `std/mem.zig` containing 2000+ lines of cohesive memory operations.\r\n"}}

After resize/reflow operations, the viewport pin can end up positioned such that `pin.y + rows > total_rows`, causing `br.down(rows-1)` to return null and panic on unwrap.\r\n     4\t\r\n     5\t**Root cause:** Viewport pin invalidation after resize/reflow. When columns change (especially growing, which unwraps rows), `total_rows` can decrease while the viewport pin remains at a position that can no longer fit `rows` rows below it. If the viewport pin ends up inside the active area after this change, the pin becomes invalid but may not be clamped if the resize path doesn't include a clamp check.\r\n     6\t\r\n     7\t**Note on synchronization:** This is NOT a race condition. Renderer reads are protected by `renderer_state.mutex` (see `generic.zig:1138`) and resize writes also hold that same mutex (see `Termio.zig:472`). The renderer cannot see a partially-updated PageList.\r\n     8\t\r\n     9\t**Additional issue:** When `getTopLeft(.viewport)` returns the stale pin and `getBottomRight(.viewport)` falls back to active, the row iterator would cover fewer than `self.rows` rows, leading to rendering inconsistencies.\r\n    10\t\r\n    11\t**Sentry event_id:** `b4c31945-c3ab-4a5b-5ef8-be7b4d4e65f6`\r\n    12\t\r\n    13\t**Crash arithmetic:**\r\n    14\t- `rows = 76`, `total_rows = 116`, `viewport_pin.y = 46`\r\n    15\t- `active_top = 116 - 76 = 40`\r\n    16\t- Pin at 46 is inside active (46 >= 40)\r\n    17\t- Pin at 46 needs row `46 + 75 = 121`, but max row is 115\r\n    18\t- Result: `down()` returns null → panic\r\n    19\t\r\n    20\t## Expected Behavior\r\n    21\t\r\n    22\tAfter resize/reflow, the viewport pin should be clamped to a valid position that can fit `rows` rows below it. If the pin ends up inside the active area, viewport should transition to `.active` mode.\r\n    23\t\r\n    24\t## Actual Behavior\r\n    25\t\r\n    26\tThe viewport remains `.pin` with a stale position, causing `getBottomRight(.viewport)` to panic when attempting to calculate the bottom-right corner.\r\n    27\t\r\n    28\t## Reproduction Steps\r\n    29\t\r\n    30\t1. Have a terminal with scrollback content\r\n    31\t2. Scroll up to pin the viewport in history\r\n    32\t3.

If this is intended as evidence from the crash, it should be labeled as illustrative or sourced. `bug-crash-reports/2025-12-26/DISCUSSION.md:13`, `src/terminal/PageList.zig:10917`\n- **Low** “Clamp after resizeCols” is slightly overbroad: the explicit clamp is only in the reflow `.lt` path; cols‑grow safety is achieved via `getTopLeft/getBottomRight` validation rather than a state clamp. `src/terminal/PageList.zig:837`, `src/terminal/PageList.zig:3907`\n\n**Verified**\n- Stack trace in the discussion matches the symbolicated backtrace and shows the crash path through `PageList.getBottomRight` → `rowIterator` → render update. `bug-crash-reports/2025-12-26/lldb_bt.txt:5`, `bug-crash-reports/2025-12-26/DISCUSSION.md:37`\n- Version/renderer/OS details match the event summary. `bug-crash-reports/2025-12-26/event_summary.json:21`\n- Locking claim is consistent with code: renderer update holds `state.mutex`, and resize holds the same `renderer_state.mutex`. `src/renderer/generic.zig:1138`, `src/termio/Termio.zig:472`\n- Fix details are present in code: viewport validation in `getTopLeft`, safety fallback in `getBottomRight`, zero‑size guard, and the documented scrollbar offset limitation. `src/terminal/PageList.zig:3907`, `src/terminal/PageList.zig:3953`, `src/terminal/PageList.zig:2343`\n\n**Certification**\nCannot certify the document as fully true and accurate until the event_id ambiguity and the “crash arithmetic” sourcing are clarified. The verified items above are accurate.\n\nIf you want a full certification, suggested edits:\n1) Clarify which event_id the discussion targets (or list both with their artifacts).\n2) Label the arithmetic as illustrative (or cite a crash artifact if it exists).\n3) Narrow the resizeCols clamp wording to the `.lt` reflow path or mention the validation fallback explicitly.\n\nNotes: no tests were run."}]}}

After resize/reflow operations, the viewport pin can end up positioned such that `pin.y + rows > total_rows`, causing `br.down(rows-1)` to return null and panic on unwrap.\r\n\r\n**Root cause:** Viewport pin invalidation after resize/reflow. When columns change (especially growing, which unwraps rows), `total_rows` can decrease while the viewport pin remains at a position that can no longer fit `rows` rows below it. If the viewport pin ends up inside the active area after this change, the pin becomes invalid but may not be clamped if the resize path doesn't include a clamp check.\r\n\r\n**Note on synchronization:** This is NOT a race condition. Renderer reads are protected by `renderer_state.mutex` (see `generic.zig:1138`) and resize writes also hold that same mutex (see `Termio.zig:472`). The renderer cannot see a partially-updated PageList.\r\n\r\n**Additional issue:** When `getTopLeft(.viewport)` returns the stale pin and `getBottomRight(.viewport)` falls back to active, the row iterator would cover fewer than `self.rows` rows, leading to rendering inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n**Sentry event_ids:** `59823ee8-74ed-47d7-c891-711833aa53d7`, `b4c31945-c3ab-4a5b-5ef8-be7b4d4e65f6` (multiple instances observed)\r\n\r\n**Crash arithmetic (illustrative, from regression test analysis):**\r\n- `rows = 76`, `total_rows = 116`, `viewport_pin.y = 46`\r\n- `active_top = 116 - 76 = 40`\r\n- Pin at 46 is inside active (46 >= 40)\r\n- Pin at 46 needs row `46 + 75 = 121`, but max row is 115\r\n- Result: `down()` returns null → panic\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAfter resize/reflow, the viewport pin should be clamped to a valid position that can fit `rows` rows below it. If the pin ends up inside the active area, viewport should transition to `.active` mode.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe viewport remains `.pin` with a stale position, causing `getBottomRight(.viewport)` to panic when attempting to calculate the bottom-right corner.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Have a terminal with scrollback content\r\n2. Scroll up to pin the viewport in history\r\n3. Resize the terminal (especially growing columns, which causes wrapped rows to unwrap)\r\n4. The crash occurs during the next render frame\r\n\r\n## Ghostty Logs\r\n\r\n```\r\n* thread #16, stop reason = EXC_SOFTWARE (code=65538, subcode=0x191e335b0)\r\n  * frame #0: 0x0000000191e335b0 libsystem_kernel.dylib`thread_policy_get + 396\r\n    frame #1: 0x0000000191d72850 libsystem_c.dylib`abort + 124\r\n    frame #2: 0x0000000101347070 ghostty`posix.abort at posix.zig:732:29 [opt]\r\n    frame #3: 0x0000000101346d30 ghostty`debug.defaultPanic at debug.zig:0 [opt]\r\n    frame #4: 0x0000000101346f98 ghostty`debug.FullPanic.unwrapNull at debug.zig:68:17 [opt]\r\n    frame #5: 0x00000001012321c4 ghostty`terminal.PageList.getBottomRight at PageList.zig:3980:22 [opt]\r\n    frame #6: 0x000000010125dbec ghostty`terminal.PageList.rowIterator at PageList.zig:3641:28 [opt]\r\n    frame #7: 0x00000001012b4388 ghostty`terminal.render.RenderState.update at render.zig:433:41 [opt]\r\n    frame #8: 0x00000001012b17a0 ghostty`renderer.generic.Renderer.updateFrame at generic.zig:1148:47 [opt]\r\n    frame #9: 0x0000000101292d68 ghostty`renderer.Thread.renderCallback at Thread.zig:607:27 [opt]\r\n    frame #10: 0x0000000101292d24 ghostty`renderer.Thread.wakeupCallback at Thread.zig:524:23 [opt]\r\n    frame #11: 0x0000000101290ebc ghostty`watcher.async.AsyncMachPort.callback at async.zig:350:34 [opt]\r\n    frame #12: 0x0000000101262fd8 ghostty`backend.kqueue.Loop.tick at kqueue.zig:540:42 [opt]\r\n    frame #13: 0x0000000101289d9c ghostty`backend.kqueue.Loop.run at kqueue.zig:303:62 [opt]\r\n    frame #14: 0x0000000101289d94 ghostty`renderer.Thread.threadMain_ at Thread.zig:262:26 [opt]\r\n    frame #15: 0x0000000101289a3c ghostty`renderer.Thread.threadMain at Thread.zig:201:21 [opt]\r\n    frame #16: 0x0000000101289a3c ghostty`Thread.callFn at Thread.zig:509:13 [opt]\r\n    frame #17: 0x0000000101289a3c ghostty`Thread.PosixThreadImpl.entryFn at Thread.zig:781:30 [opt]\r\n    frame #18: 0x0000000191e6dc08 libsystem_kernel.dylib\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Ghostty Version\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.3.0-main+517716898\r\nBuild mode: ReleaseSafe\r\nRenderer: metal\r\n```\r\n\r\n## OS Version\r\n\r\nmacOS 26.1.0 (build 25B78)\r\n\r\n## Minimal Config\r\n\r\nDefault configuration.

Follow this workflow:\r\n\r\n1. **Define data structures** - structs, unions, and error sets first\r\n2. **Define function signatures** - parameters, return types, and error unions\r\n3. **Implement to satisfy types** - let the compiler guide completeness\r\n4. **Validate at comptime** - catch invalid configurations during compilation\r\n\r\n### Make Illegal States Unrepresentable\r\n\r\nUse Zig's type system to prevent invalid states at compile time.\r\n\r\n**Tagged unions for mutually exclusive states:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: only valid combinations possible\r\nconst RequestState = union(enum) {\r\n    idle,\r\n    loading,\r\n    success: []const u8,\r\n    failure: anyerror,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn handleState(state: RequestState) void {\r\n    switch (state) {\r\n        .idle => {},\r\n        .loading => showSpinner(),\r\n        .success => |data| render(data),\r\n        .failure => |err| showError(err),\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: allows invalid combinations\r\nconst RequestState = struct {\r\n    loading: bool,\r\n    data: ?[]const u8,\r\n    err: ?anyerror,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explicit error sets for failure modes:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: documents exactly what can fail\r\nconst ParseError = error{\r\n    InvalidSyntax,\r\n    UnexpectedToken,\r\n    EndOfInput,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) ParseError!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: anyerror hides failure modes\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) anyerror!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Distinct types for domain concepts:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Prevent mixing up IDs of different types\r\nconst UserId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\nconst OrderId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\n\r\nfn getUser(id: UserId) !User {\r\n    // Compiler prevents passing OrderId here\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn createUserId(raw: u64) UserId {\r\n    return @enumFromInt(raw);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Comptime validation for invariants:**\r\n```zig\r\nfn Buffer(comptime size: usize) type {\r\n    if (size == 0) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size must be greater than 0\");\r\n    }\r\n    if (size > 1024 * 1024) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size exceeds 1MB limit\");\r\n    }\r\n    return struct {\r\n        data: [size]u8 = undefined,\r\n        len: usize = 0,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Non-exhaustive enums for extensibility:**\r\n```zig\r\n// External enum that may gain variants\r\nconst Status = enum(u8) {\r\n    active = 1,\r\n    inactive = 2,\r\n    pending = 3,\r\n    _,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn processStatus(status: Status) !void {\r\n    switch (status) {\r\n        .active => {},\r\n        .inactive => {},\r\n        .pending => {},\r\n        _ => return error.UnknownStatus,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Module Structure\r\n\r\nLarger cohesive files are idiomatic in Zig. Keep related code together: tests alongside implementation, comptime generics at file scope, public/private controlled by `pub`. Split only when a file handles genuinely separate concerns. The standard library demonstrates this pattern with files like `std/mem.zig` containing 2000+ lines of cohesive memory operations.\r\n"}}

Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, tilt commands | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# Agent Development Guide\n\nA file for [guiding coding agents](https://agents.md/).\n\n## Commands\n\n- **Build:** `zig build`\n- **Test (Zig):** `zig build test`\n- **Test filter (Zig)**: `zig build test -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- **Formatting (Zig)**: `zig fmt .`\n- **Formatting (other)**: `prettier -w .`\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n- Shared Zig core: `src/`\n- C API: `include`\n- macOS app: `macos/`\n- GTK (Linux and FreeBSD) app: `src/apprt/gtk`\n\n## libghostty-vt\n\n- Build: `zig build lib-vt`\n- Build Wasm Module: `zig build lib-vt -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding`\n- Test: `zig build test-lib-vt`\n- Test filter: `zig build test-lib-vt -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- When working on libghostty-vt, do not build the full app.\n- For C only changes, don't run the Zig tests. Build all the examples.\n\n## macOS App\n\n- Do not use `xcodebuild`\n- Use `zig build` to build the macOS app and any shared Zig code\n- Use `zig build run` to build and run the macOS app\n- Run Xcode tests using `zig build test`\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/Users/allen/0xbigboss/ghostty</cwd>\n  <approval_policy>never</approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>danger-full-access</sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>enabled</network_access>\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\n</environment_context>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"review and certify this bug-crash-reports/2025-12-26/DISCUSSION.md is true and accurate"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"Fixed all three issues:\n\n  1.

Use when debugging Ghostty renderer crashes, OSC8 hover issues, or any panic/index-out-of-bounds reports captured in ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash.\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Ghostty Crash Triage\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nExtract a Sentry envelope from `~/.local/state/ghostty/crash`, match its debug ID to a dSYM, symbolicate the minidump, and write a minimal bug report with evidence in the repo archive.\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nRun the one-command triage:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython .claude/skills/ghostty-crash-triage/scripts/triage.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will:\r\n1. Select the newest crash file\r\n2. Extract the minidump and event metadata\r\n3. Search for a matching dSYM\r\n4. Symbolicate with lldb (or fall back to atos if dSYM is unavailable)\r\n5. Generate a REPORT.md skeleton\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Triage a specific crash file\r\npython scripts/triage.py ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/<id>.ghosttycrash\r\n\r\n# Specify output directory\r\npython scripts/triage.py --out-dir bug-crash-reports/my-issue\r\n\r\n# Add extra dSYM search paths\r\npython scripts/triage.py --dsym-search ~/my-dsyms\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Output Files\r\n\r\nAfter running triage, the output directory contains:\r\n\r\n| File | Description |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| `<id>.ghosttycrash` | Original crash envelope (copied) |\r\n| `<uuid>.dmp` | Extracted minidump |\r\n| `event_summary.json` | Parsed event metadata (release, OS, debug_id, etc.) |\r\n| `dsym_uuids.txt` | All discovered dSYM UUIDs for reference |\r\n| `lldb_bt.txt` | Symbolicated (or raw) backtrace from lldb |\r\n| `atos_bt.txt` | Fallback symbolication via atos (if dSYM unavailable) |\r\n| `REPORT.md` | Bug report skeleton to fill in |\r\n\r\n## dSYM Archive Strategy\r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\n\r\ndSYM files are required for symbolication but are lost when the app is rebuilt. If you rebuild Ghostty after a crash, the new dSYM won't match the crash's `debug_id`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended Solution\r\n\r\nArchive dSYMs by debug_id in `~/.ghostty-dsyms/`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/.ghostty-dsyms/\r\n├── 02F9811F-0F22-3C7B-BC89-79A31322DB2B/\r\n│   └── Ghostty.app.dSYM/\r\n├── BD9D9D6C-F0AB-318A-90A2-3192BFC87875/\r\n│   └── Ghostty.app.dSYM/\r\n└── ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter building a release, archive the dSYM:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Get the debug_id from the dSYM\r\nUUID=$(dwarfdump --uuid macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM | grep arm64 | awk '{print $2}')\r\n\r\n# Archive it\r\nmkdir -p ~/.ghostty-dsyms/$UUID\r\ncp -r macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM ~/.ghostty-dsyms/$UUID/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe triage script automatically searches `~/.ghostty-dsyms/` for matching dSYMs.\r\n\r\n### Search Order\r\n\r\nThe triage script searches these locations (in order):\r\n\r\n1. Extra paths via `--dsym-search`\r\n2. `~/.ghostty-dsyms/` (archived dSYMs)\r\n3. `macos/build/ReleaseLocal/` (local build)\r\n4. `/Applications/Ghostty.app/` (installed app)\r\n\r\nModify `scripts/config.json` to customize the search paths.\r\n\r\n## Manual Workflow\r\n\r\nFor advanced use, the individual scripts can be run manually:\r\n\r\n### 1) Extract the envelope\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython scripts/extract_sentry_envelope.py \\\r\n  ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/<id>.ghosttycrash \\\r\n  bug-crash-reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2) Match debug_id to a dSYM\r\n\r\nRead `ghostty_image.debug_id` from `event_summary.json` and compare:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndwarfdump --uuid macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3) Symbolicate with lldb\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/lldb_bt.sh \\\r\n  bug-crash-reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<minidump>.dmp \\\r\n  /Applications/Ghostty.app/Contents/MacOS/ghostty \\\r\n  macos/build/ReleaseLocal \\\r\n  bug-crash-reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>/lldb_bt.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4) Fallback with atos (if no matching dSYM)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Get load address from event_summary.json (image_addr field)\r\natos -o /path/to/ghostty -arch arm64 -l 0x100eec000 \\\r\n  0x00000001015b5d38 0x00000001015b59f8 ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Scripts\r\n\r\n| Script | Description |\r\n|--------|-------------|\r\n| `triage.py` | One-command orchestrator (recommended) |\r\n| `extract_sentry_envelope.py` | Parse `.ghosttycrash`, extract minidump |\r\n| `lldb_bt.sh` | Run lldb on a minidump, filter to frames |\r\n| `config.json` | Configuration for search paths and thresholds |\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nEdit `scripts/config.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"dsym_search_paths\": [\r\n    \"~/.ghostty-dsyms\",\r\n    \"macos/build/ReleaseLocal\",\r\n    \"/Applications/Ghostty.app/Contents/MacOS\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"crash_dir\": \"~/.local/state/ghostty/crash\",\r\n  \"output_root\": \"bug-crash-reports\",\r\n  \"unsymbolicated_threshold\": 0.5\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `dsym_search_paths`: Directories to search for dSYMs and binaries\r\n- `crash_dir`: Where Ghostty writes crash files\r\n- `output_root`: Base directory for triage output\r\n- `unsymbolicated_threshold`: Ratio of unsymbolicated frames to trigger atos fallback\r\n\r\n## Creating GitHub Discussions\r\n\r\nGhostty uses GitHub Discussions as the first line of reporting for bugs and crashes. After triaging a crash, create a `DISCUSSION.md` file in the output directory following the Issue Triage template.\r\n\r\n### Discussion Template\r\n\r\nThe discussion should include:\r\n\r\n| Section | Description |\r\n|---------|-------------|\r\n| Issue Description | Detailed description with root cause, trigger, Sentry UUID, and symbolicated stack trace |\r\n| Expected Behavior | What should happen (e.g., \"empty slice should be a no-op\") |\r\n| Actual Behavior | What actually happens (the crash) |\r\n| Reproduction Steps | Steps to trigger the crash |\r\n| Ghostty Logs | The panic message and relevant stack frames |\r\n| Ghostty Version | Output from `event_summary.json` or `ghostty +version` |\r\n| OS Version | From `event_summary.json` contexts.os |\r\n| Minimal Config | Configuration needed to reproduce (or \"default\") |\r\n| Fix (if available) | Commit hash and summary of the fix |\r\n\r\nSee `bug-crash-reports/2025-12-25/DISCUSSION.md` for an example.\r\n\r\n### Creating via GitHub CLI\r\n\r\nAfter writing `DISCUSSION.md`, create the discussion using the GraphQL API:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Read the discussion content\r\nBODY=$(cat bug-crash-reports/<date>/DISCUSSION.md)\r\nTITLE=\"Search thread crash: integer underflow in CircBuf.getPtrSlice\"\r\n\r\n# Create the discussion\r\ngh api graphql -f query='\r\nmutation($repositoryId: ID!, $categoryId: ID!, $title: String!, $body: String!) {\r\n  createDiscussion(input: {\r\n"}}
