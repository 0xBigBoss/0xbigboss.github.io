Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, tilt commands | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"exec","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"9a75a24834923014ce955c20e6f5e52727f62ee4","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:0xsend/sentinel.git"}}}

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Phase 4 focuses on implementing actual business logic in services that have NO external vendor dependencies, enabling full flow testing with mock data. Vendor adapters will be added later behind abstract interfaces.\r\n</context>\r\n\r\n<key_files>\r\nArchitecture and design docs:\r\n- `docs/risk-scoring.md` - Risk factor weights, score calculation, velocity checks\r\n- `docs/rules-engine.md` - Rule DSL, threshold evaluation, governance\r\n- `docs/case-management.md` - Alert lifecycle, case states, evidence chain\r\n- `docs/architecture.md` - Overall system design, data models\r\n\r\nService implementations to build:\r\n- `src/services/scoring/main.zig` - Risk calculation, tier assignment\r\n- `src/services/case_management/main.zig` - Alert/case CRUD, state machine\r\n- `src/services/admin/main.zig` - Rule CRUD, tenant config\r\n\r\nSupporting libraries:\r\n- `src/lib/` - db, cache, queue, proto (already implemented)\r\n\r\nDatabase schema:\r\n- `infrastructure/migrations/` - 3 SQL migrations (tables exist)\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n- `src/tests/integration/main.zig` - Integration tests\r\n- `packages/e2e-tests/src/flows.test.ts` - E2E flow tests\r\n</key_files>\r\n\r\n<phase4_tasks>\r\nComplete these in order. Each task should be committed separately.\r\n\r\n## 1. Scoring Service Implementation\r\nPer `docs/risk-scoring.md`:\r\n- Implement risk factor evaluation (geography, behavior, counterparty, velocity)\r\n- Score calculation (0-100 scale with configurable weights)\r\n- Risk tier assignment (LOW < 25, MEDIUM < 50, HIGH < 75, PROHIBITED >= 75)\r\n- Velocity checks (transaction count/volume per time window)\r\n- Store scores in database, expose via Connect RPC\r\n\r\n## 2. Rules Engine Library\r\nPer `docs/rules-engine.md`:\r\n- Create `src/lib/rules/` module\r\n- Rule types: VELOCITY, AMOUNT_THRESHOLD, PATTERN, GEOGRAPHY\r\n- Rule evaluation against transaction context\r\n- Rule storage and retrieval (admin-managed)\r\n- Audit trail for rule changes\r\n\r\n## 3. Case Management Service Implementation\r\nPer `docs/case-management.md`:\r\n- Alert CRUD (create from screening results, list, update status)\r\n- Case CRUD (create from alerts, assign, escalate)\r\n- Case state machine: OPEN → IN_INVESTIGATION → SAR_PENDING → SAR_FILED/CLOSED_NO_ACTION\r\n- Evidence attachment (store references, validate types)\r\n- Assignment and escalation logic\r\n\r\n## 4. Admin Service - Rule Management\r\n- Rule CRUD endpoints (create, list, update, delete)\r\n- Rule versioning (track changes)\r\n- Tenant-scoped rules (RLS)\r\n\r\n## 5. Wire Services Together\r\n- Screening → Scoring (get risk score for addresses)\r\n- Scoring → Rules (evaluate rules against transaction)\r\n- Rules trigger → Case Management (create alert)\r\n- Update E2E tests to validate full flow\r\n</phase4_tasks>\r\n\r\n<vendor_abstraction>\r\nDefine abstract interfaces for future vendor integration:\r\n\r\n```zig\r\n// src/lib/vendors/types.zig\r\npub const WalletRiskProvider = struct {\r\n    getAddressRisk: *const fn (allocator: Allocator, address: []const u8) WalletRiskResult,\r\n\r\n    pub const WalletRiskResult = struct {\r\n        risk_score: u8,  // 0-100\r\n        risk_signals: []const RiskSignal,\r\n        cached: bool,\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\npub const SanctionsProvider = struct {\r\n    checkName: *const fn (allocator: Allocator, name: []const u8) SanctionsResult,\r\n    checkAddress: *const fn (allocator: Allocator, address: []const u8) SanctionsResult,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Phase 4, implement mock providers that return configurable test data.\r\n</vendor_abstraction>\r\n\r\n<success_criteria>\r\nAll must be true:\r\n1. `zig build` succeeds with no errors\r\n2. `zig build test` passes all unit tests\r\n3. `zig build integration-test` passes with DATABASE_URL set\r\n4. Scoring service calculates risk scores and assigns tiers correctly\r\n5. Rules engine evaluates VELOCITY and AMOUNT_THRESHOLD rules\r\n6. Case management creates alerts and progresses case states\r\n7. E2E flow tests pass: screening → score → alert → case → SAR\r\n8. All changes committed with conventional commits\r\n9. `git status` shows clean working tree\r\n</success_criteria>\r\n\r\n<verification_loop>\r\nRun these commands sequentially. Fix failures before proceeding.\r\n\r\n1. Build all services:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   zig build\r\n   ```\r\n   If fails, fix compilation errors.\r\n\r\n2. Run unit tests:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   zig build test\r\n   ```\r\n   If fails, fix test failures.\r\n\r\n3. Run integration tests (requires PostgreSQL):\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Start database if not running\r\n   docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres\r\n   sleep 5\r\n   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://sentinel:sentinel@localhost:5432/sentinel_test \\\r\n     SKIP_HTTP_TESTS=1 zig build integration-test\r\n   ```\r\n   If fails, check database connectivity and test logic.\r\n\r\n4. Run E2E tests (requires full stack):\r\n   ```bash\r\n   tilt up --stream &\r\n   sleep 30\r\n   cd packages/e2e-tests && bun test\r\n   tilt down\r\n   ```\r\n   If fails, check service logs and fix flow issues.\r\n\r\n5. Verify TypeScript client still builds:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   bun run --filter @sentinel/connect-client build\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n6. Final verification:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   git status --short\r\n   ```\r\n   Should be empty (clean working tree).\r\n\r\nWhen ALL verifications pass, output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>\r\n</verification_loop>\r\n\r\n<implementation_notes>\r\n- Use existing `src/lib/db/` for database operations\r\n- Use existing `src/lib/proto/` for protobuf serialization\r\n- Use existing `src/lib/queue/` for async message processing\r\n- Risk scores are stored in `wallet_risk_cache` table\r\n- Rules are stored in `rules` table (see migrations)\r\n- Alerts/cases use `alerts` and `cases` tables\r\n- All operations are tenant-scoped via RLS\r\n</implementation_notes>\r\n\r\n<if_stuck>\r\nAfter 15+ iterations without progress:\r\n- Document what's blocking in `BLOCKED.md` at repo root\r\n- List approaches attempted\r\n- Include exact error messages\r\n- Suggest alternative paths or questions for the user\r\n- Output: <promise>BLOCKED</promise>\r\n</if_stuck>\r\n</content>\r\n</invoke>"}}

Must use when reading or writing Zig files.\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Zig Best Practices\r\n\r\n## Type-First Development\r\n\r\nTypes define the contract before implementation. Follow this workflow:\r\n\r\n1. **Define data structures** - structs, unions, and error sets first\r\n2. **Define function signatures** - parameters, return types, and error unions\r\n3. **Implement to satisfy types** - let the compiler guide completeness\r\n4. **Validate at comptime** - catch invalid configurations during compilation\r\n\r\n### Make Illegal States Unrepresentable\r\n\r\nUse Zig's type system to prevent invalid states at compile time.\r\n\r\n**Tagged unions for mutually exclusive states:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: only valid combinations possible\r\nconst RequestState = union(enum) {\r\n    idle,\r\n    loading,\r\n    success: []const u8,\r\n    failure: anyerror,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn handleState(state: RequestState) void {\r\n    switch (state) {\r\n        .idle => {},\r\n        .loading => showSpinner(),\r\n        .success => |data| render(data),\r\n        .failure => |err| showError(err),\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: allows invalid combinations\r\nconst RequestState = struct {\r\n    loading: bool,\r\n    data: ?[]const u8,\r\n    err: ?anyerror,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explicit error sets for failure modes:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: documents exactly what can fail\r\nconst ParseError = error{\r\n    InvalidSyntax,\r\n    UnexpectedToken,\r\n    EndOfInput,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) ParseError!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: anyerror hides failure modes\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) anyerror!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Distinct types for domain concepts:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Prevent mixing up IDs of different types\r\nconst UserId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\nconst OrderId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\n\r\nfn getUser(id: UserId) !User {\r\n    // Compiler prevents passing OrderId here\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn createUserId(raw: u64) UserId {\r\n    return @enumFromInt(raw);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Comptime validation for invariants:**\r\n```zig\r\nfn Buffer(comptime size: usize) type {\r\n    if (size == 0) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size must be greater than 0\");\r\n    }\r\n    if (size > 1024 * 1024) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size exceeds 1MB limit\");\r\n    }\r\n    return struct {\r\n        data: [size]u8 = undefined,\r\n        len: usize = 0,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Non-exhaustive enums for extensibility:**\r\n```zig\r\n// External enum that may gain variants\r\nconst Status = enum(u8) {\r\n    active = 1,\r\n    inactive = 2,\r\n    pending = 3,\r\n    _,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn processStatus(status: Status) !void {\r\n    switch (status) {\r\n        .active => {},\r\n        .inactive => {},\r\n        .pending => {},\r\n        _ => return error.UnknownStatus,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Module Structure\r\n\r\nLarger cohesive files are idiomatic in Zig. Keep related code together: tests alongside implementation, comptime generics at file scope, public/private controlled by `pub`. Split only when a file handles genuinely separate concerns. The standard library demonstrates this pattern with files like `std/mem.zig` containing 2000+ lines of cohesive memory operations.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n- Return errors with context using error unions (`!T`); every function returns a value or an error. Explicit error sets document failure modes.\r\n- Use `errdefer` for cleanup on error paths; use `defer` for unconditional cleanup. This prevents resource leaks without try-finally boilerplate.\r\n- Handle all branches in `switch` statements; include an `else` clause that returns an error or uses `unreachable` for truly impossible cases.\r\n- Pass allocators explicitly to functions requiring dynamic memory; prefer `std.testing.allocator` in tests for leak detection.\r\n- Prefer `const` over `var`; prefer slices over raw pointers for bounds safety. Immutability signals intent and enables optimizations.\r\n- Avoid `anytype`; prefer explicit `comptime T: type` parameters. Explicit types document intent and produce clearer error messages.\r\n- Use `std.log.scoped` for namespaced logging; define a module-level `log` constant for consistent scope across the file.\r\n- Add or update tests for new logic; use `std.testing.allocator` to catch memory leaks automatically.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nExplicit failure for unimplemented logic:\r\n```zig\r\nfn buildWidget(widget_type: []const u8) !Widget {\r\n    return error.NotImplemented;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPropagate errors with try:\r\n```zig\r\nfn readConfig(path: []const u8) !Config {\r\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(path, .{});\r\n    defer file.close();\r\n    const contents = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, max_size);\r\n    return parseConfig(contents);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResource cleanup with errdefer:\r\n```zig\r\nfn createResource(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !*Resource {\r\n    const resource = try allocator.create(Resource);\r\n    errdefer allocator.destroy(resource);\r\n\r\n    resource.* = try initializeResource();\r\n    return resource;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExhaustive switch with explicit default:\r\n```zig\r\nfn processStatus(status: Status) ![]const u8 {\r\n    return switch (status) {\r\n        .active => \"processing\",\r\n        .inactive => \"skipped\",\r\n        _ => error.UnhandledStatus,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTesting with memory leak detection:\r\n```zig\r\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\r\n\r\ntest \"widget creation\" {\r\n    const allocator = std.testing.allocator;\r\n    var list: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(u32) = .empty;\r\n    defer list.deinit(allocator);\r\n\r\n    try list.append(allocator, 42);\r\n    try std.testing.expectEqual(1, list.items.len);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Memory Management\r\n\r\n- Pass allocators explicitly; never use global state for allocation. Functions declare their allocation needs in parameters.\r\n- Use `defer` immediately after acquiring a resource. Place cleanup logic next to acquisition for clarity.\r\n- Prefer arena allocators for temporary allocations; they free everything at once when the arena is destroyed.\r\n- Use `std.testing.allocator` in tests; it reports leaks with stack traces showing allocation origins.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nAllocator as explicit parameter:\r\n```zig\r\nfn processData(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, input: []const u8) ![]u8 {\r\n    const result = try allocator.alloc(u8, input.len * 2);\r\n    errdefer allocator.free(result);\r\n\r\n    // process input into result\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nArena allocator for batch operations:\r\n```zig\r\nfn processBatch(items: []const Item) !void {\r\n    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);\r\n    defer arena.deinit();\r\n    const allocator = arena.allocator();\r\n\r\n    for (items) |item| {\r\n        const processed = try processItem(allocator, item);\r\n        try outputResult(processed);\r\n    }\r\n    // All allocations freed when arena deinits\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Logging\r\n\r\n- Use `std.log.scoped` to create namespaced loggers; each module should define its own scoped logger for filtering.\r\n- Define a module-level `const log` at the top of the file; use it consistently throughout the module.\r\n- Use appropriate log levels: `err` for failures, `warn` for suspicious conditions, `info` for state changes, `debug` for tracing.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nScoped logger for a module:\r\n```zig\r\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.widgets);\r\n\r\npub fn createWidget(name: []const u8) !Widget {\r\n    log.debug(\"creating widget: {s}\", .{name});\r\n    const widget = try allocateWidget(name);\r\n    log.debug(\"created widget id={d}\", .{widget.id});\r\n    return widget;\r\n}\r\n\r\npub fn deleteWidget(id: u32) void {\r\n    log.info(\"deleting widget id={d}\", .{id});\r\n    // cleanup\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMultiple scopes in a codebase:\r\n```zig\r\n// In src/db.zig\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.db);\r\n\r\n// In src/http.zig\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.http);\r\n\r\n// In src/auth.zig\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.auth);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Comptime Patterns\r\n\r\n- Use `comptime` parameters for generic functions; type information is available at compile time with zero runtime cost.\r\n- Prefer compile-time validation over runtime checks when possible. Catch errors during compilation rather than in production.\r\n- Use `@compileError` for invalid configurations that should fail the build.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nGeneric function with comptime type:\r\n```zig\r\nfn max(comptime T: type, a: T, b: T) T {\r\n    return if (a > b) a else b;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompile-time validation:\r\n```zig\r\nfn createBuffer(comptime size: usize) [size]u8 {\r\n    if (size == 0) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size must be greater than 0\");\r\n    }\r\n    return [_]u8{0} ** size;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Avoiding anytype\r\n\r\n- Prefer `comptime T: type` over `anytype`; explicit type parameters document expected constraints and produce clearer errors.\r\n- Use `anytype` only when the function genuinely accepts any type (like `std.debug.print`) or for callbacks/closures.\r\n- When using `anytype`, add a doc comment describing the expected interface or constraints.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nPrefer explicit comptime type (good):\r\n```zig\r\nfn sum(comptime T: type, items: []const T) T {\r\n    var total: T = 0;\r\n    for (items) |item| {\r\n        total += item;\r\n    }\r\n    return total;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAvoid anytype when type is known (bad):\r\n```zig\r\n// Unclear what types are valid; error messages will be confusing\r\nfn sum(items: anytype) @TypeOf(items[0]) {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAcceptable anytype for callbacks:\r\n```zig\r\n/// Calls `callback` for each item. Callback must accept (T) and return void.\r\nfn forEach(comptime T: type, items: []const T, callback: anytype) void {\r\n    for (items) |item| {\r\n        callback(item);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing @TypeOf when anytype is necessary:\r\n```zig\r\nfn debugPrint(value: anytype) void {\r\n    const T = @TypeOf(value);\r\n    if (@typeInfo(T) == .Pointer) {\r\n        std.debug.print(\"ptr: {*}\\n\", .{value});\r\n    } else {\r\n        std.debug.print(\"val: {}\\n\", .{value});\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Error Handling Patterns\r\n\r\n- Define specific error sets for functions; avoid `anyerror` when possible. Specific errors document failure modes.\r\n- Use `catch` with a block for error recovery or logging; use `catch unreachable` only when errors are truly impossible.\r\n- Merge error sets with `||` when combining operations that can fail in different ways.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nSpecific error set:\r\n```zig\r\nconst ConfigError = error{\r\n    FileNotFound,\r\n    ParseError,\r\n    InvalidFormat,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn loadConfig(path: []const u8) ConfigError!Config {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nError handling with catch block:\r\n```zig\r\nconst value = operation() catch |err| {\r\n    std.log.err(\"operation failed: {}\", .{err});\r\n    return error.OperationFailed;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n- Load config from environment variables at startup; validate required values before use. Missing config should cause a clean exit with a descriptive message.\r\n- Define a Config struct as single source of truth; avoid `std.posix.getenv` scattered throughout code.\r\n- Use sensible defaults for development; require explicit values for production secrets.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nTyped config struct:\r\n```zig\r\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\r\n\r\npub const Config = struct {\r\n    port: u16,\r\n    database_url: []const u8,\r\n    api_key: []const u8,\r\n    env: []const u8,\r\n};\r\n\r\npub fn loadConfig() !Config {\r\n    const db_url = std.posix.getenv(\"DATABASE_URL\") orelse\r\n        return error.MissingDatabaseUrl;\r\n    const api_key = std.posix.getenv(\"API_KEY\") orelse\r\n        return error.MissingApiKey;\r\n    const port_str = std.posix.getenv(\"PORT\") orelse \"3000\";\r\n    const port = std.fmt.parseInt(u16, port_str, 10) catch\r\n        return error.InvalidPort;\r\n\r\n    return .{\r\n        .port = port,\r\n        .database_url = db_url,\r\n        .api_key = api_key,\r\n        .env = std.posix.getenv(\"ENV\") orelse \"development\",\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Optionals\r\n\r\n- Use `orelse` to provide default values for optionals; use `.?` only when null is a program error.\r\n- Prefer `if (optional) |value|` pattern for safe unwrapping with access to the value.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nSafe optional handling:\r\n```zig\r\nfn findWidget(id: u32) ?*Widget {\r\n    // lookup implementation\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn processWidget(id: u32) !void {\r\n    const widget = findWidget(id) orelse return error.WidgetNotFound;\r\n    try widget.process();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptional with if unwrapping:\r\n```zig\r\nif (maybeValue) |value| {\r\n    try processValue(value);\r\n} else {\r\n    std.log.warn(\"no value present\", .{});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Advanced Topics\r\n\r\nReference these guides for specialized patterns:\r\n\r\n- **Building custom containers** (queues, stacks, trees): See [GENERICS.md](GENERICS.md)\r\n- **Interfacing with C libraries** (raylib, SDL, curl, system APIs): See [C-INTEROP.md](C-INTEROP.md)\r\n- **Debugging memory leaks** (GPA, stack traces): See [DEBUGGING.md](DEBUGGING.md)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- Language Reference: https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.2/\r\n- Standard Library: https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.2/std/\r\n- Code Samples: https://ziglang.org/learn/samples/\r\n- Zig Guide: https://zig.guide/\r\n"}}

Must use when reading or writing TypeScript/JavaScript files.\r\n---\r\n\r\n# TypeScript Best Practices\r\n\r\n## Pair with React Best Practices\r\n\r\nWhen working with React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx` files or `@react` imports), always load `react-best-practices` alongside this skill. This skill covers TypeScript fundamentals; React-specific patterns (effects, hooks, refs, component design) are in the dedicated React skill.\r\n\r\n## Type-First Development\r\n\r\nTypes define the contract before implementation. Follow this workflow:\r\n\r\n1. **Define the data model** - types, interfaces, and schemas first\r\n2. **Define function signatures** - input/output types before logic\r\n3. **Implement to satisfy types** - let the compiler guide completeness\r\n4. **Validate at boundaries** - runtime checks where data enters the system\r\n\r\n### Make Illegal States Unrepresentable\r\n\r\nUse the type system to prevent invalid states at compile time.\r\n\r\n**Discriminated unions for mutually exclusive states:**\r\n```ts\r\n// Good: only valid combinations possible\r\ntype RequestState<T> =\r\n  | { status: 'idle' }\r\n  | { status: 'loading' }\r\n  | { status: 'success'; data: T }\r\n  | { status: 'error'; error: Error };\r\n\r\n// Bad: allows invalid combinations like { loading: true, error: Error }\r\ntype RequestState<T> = {\r\n  loading: boolean;\r\n  data?: T;\r\n  error?: Error;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Branded types for domain primitives:**\r\n```ts\r\ntype UserId = string & { readonly __brand: 'UserId' };\r\ntype OrderId = string & { readonly __brand: 'OrderId' };\r\n\r\n// Compiler prevents passing OrderId where UserId expected\r\nfunction getUser(id: UserId): Promise<User> { /* ... */ }\r\n\r\nfunction createUserId(id: string): UserId {\r\n  return id as UserId;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Const assertions for literal unions:**\r\n```ts\r\nconst ROLES = ['admin', 'user', 'guest'] as const;\r\ntype Role = typeof ROLES[number]; // 'admin' | 'user' | 'guest'\r\n\r\n// Array and type stay in sync automatically\r\nfunction isValidRole(role: string): role is Role {\r\n  return ROLES.includes(role as Role);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Required vs optional fields - be explicit:**\r\n```ts\r\n// Creation: some fields required\r\ntype CreateUser = {\r\n  email: string;\r\n  name: string;\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Update: all fields optional\r\ntype UpdateUser = Partial<CreateUser>;\r\n\r\n// Database row: all fields present\r\ntype User = CreateUser & {\r\n  id: UserId;\r\n  createdAt: Date;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Module Structure\r\n\r\nPrefer smaller, focused files: one component, hook, or utility per file. Split when a file handles multiple concerns or exceeds ~200 lines. Colocate tests with implementation (`foo.test.ts` alongside `foo.ts`). Group related files by feature rather than by type.\r\n\r\n## Functional Patterns\r\n\r\n- Prefer `const` over `let`; use `readonly` and `Readonly<T>` for immutable data.\r\n- Use `array.map/filter/reduce` over `for` loops; chain transformations in pipelines.\r\n- Write pure functions for business logic; isolate side effects in dedicated modules.\r\n- Avoid mutating function parameters; return new objects/arrays instead.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n- Enable `strict` mode; model data with interfaces and types. Strong typing catches bugs at compile time.\r\n- Every code path returns a value or throws; use exhaustive `switch` with `never` checks in default. Unhandled cases become compile errors.\r\n- Propagate errors with context; catching requires re-throwing or returning a meaningful result. Hidden failures delay debugging.\r\n- Handle edge cases explicitly: empty arrays, null/undefined inputs, boundary values. Defensive checks prevent runtime surprises.\r\n- Use `await` for async calls; wrap external calls with contextual error messages. Unhandled rejections crash Node processes.\r\n- Add or update focused tests when changing logic; test behavior, not implementation details.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nExplicit failure for unimplemented logic:\r\n```ts\r\nexport function buildWidget(widgetType: string): never {\r\n  throw new Error(`buildWidget not implemented for type: ${widgetType}`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExhaustive switch with never check:\r\n```ts\r\ntype Status = \"active\" | \"inactive\";\r\n\r\nexport function processStatus(status: Status): string {\r\n  switch (status) {\r\n    case \"active\":\r\n      return \"processing\";\r\n    case \"inactive\":\r\n      return \"skipped\";\r\n    default: {\r\n      const _exhaustive: never = status;\r\n      throw new Error(`unhandled status: ${_exhaustive}`);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWrap external calls with context:\r\n```ts\r\nexport async function fetchWidget(id: string): Promise<Widget> {\r\n  const response = await fetch(`/api/widgets/${id}`);\r\n  if (!response.ok) {\r\n    throw new Error(`fetch widget ${id} failed: ${response.status}`);\r\n  }\r\n  return response.json();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDebug logging with namespaced logger:\r\n```ts\r\nimport debug from \"debug\";\r\n\r\nconst log = debug(\"myapp:widgets\");\r\n\r\nexport function createWidget(name: string): Widget {\r\n  log(\"creating widget: %s\", name);\r\n  const widget = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), name };\r\n  log(\"created widget: %s\", widget.id);\r\n  return widget;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Runtime Validation with Zod\r\n\r\n- Define schemas as single source of truth; infer TypeScript types with `z.infer<>`. Avoid duplicating types and schemas.\r\n- Use `safeParse` for user input where failure is expected; use `parse` at trust boundaries where invalid data is a bug.\r\n- Compose schemas with `.extend()`, `.pick()`, `.omit()`, `.merge()` for DRY definitions.\r\n- Add `.transform()` for data normalization at parse time (trim strings, parse dates).\r\n- Include descriptive error messages; use `.refine()` for custom validation logic.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nSchema as source of truth with type inference:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\r\n\r\nconst UserSchema = z.object({\r\n  id: z.string().uuid(),\r\n  email: z.string().email(),\r\n  name: z.string().min(1),\r\n  createdAt: z.string().transform((s) => new Date(s)),\r\n});\r\n\r\ntype User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn parse results to callers (never swallow errors):\r\n```ts\r\nimport { z, SafeParseReturnType } from \"zod\";\r\n\r\nexport function parseUserInput(raw: unknown): SafeParseReturnType<unknown, User> {\r\n  return UserSchema.safeParse(raw);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Caller handles both success and error:\r\nconst result = parseUserInput(formData);\r\nif (!result.success) {\r\n  setErrors(result.error.flatten().fieldErrors);\r\n  return;\r\n}\r\nawait submitUser(result.data);\r\n```\r\n\r\nStrict parsing at trust boundaries:\r\n```ts\r\nexport async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User> {\r\n  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);\r\n  if (!response.ok) {\r\n    throw new Error(`fetch user ${id} failed: ${response.status}`);\r\n  }\r\n  const data = await response.json();\r\n  return UserSchema.parse(data); // throws if API contract violated\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSchema composition:\r\n```ts\r\nconst CreateUserSchema = UserSchema.omit({ id: true, createdAt: true });\r\nconst UpdateUserSchema = CreateUserSchema.partial();\r\nconst UserWithPostsSchema = UserSchema.extend({\r\n  posts: z.array(PostSchema),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n- Load config from environment variables at startup; validate with Zod before use. Invalid config should crash immediately.\r\n- Define a typed config object as single source of truth; avoid accessing `process.env` throughout the codebase.\r\n- Use sensible defaults for development; require explicit values for production secrets.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nTyped config with Zod validation:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\r\n\r\nconst ConfigSchema = z.object({\r\n  PORT: z.coerce.number().default(3000),\r\n  DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),\r\n  API_KEY: z.string().min(1),\r\n  NODE_ENV: z.enum([\"development\", \"production\", \"test\"]).default(\"development\"),\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport const config = ConfigSchema.parse(process.env);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccess config values (not process.env directly):\r\n```ts\r\nimport { config } from \"./config\";\r\n\r\nconst server = app.listen(config.PORT);\r\nconst db = connect(config.DATABASE_URL);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Optional: type-fest\r\n\r\nFor advanced type utilities beyond TypeScript builtins, consider [type-fest](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest):\r\r\n\r\n- `Opaque<T, Token>` - cleaner branded types than manual `& { __brand }` pattern\r\n- `PartialDeep<T>` - recursive partial for nested objects\r\n- `ReadonlyDeep<T>` - recursive readonly for immutable data\r\n- `LiteralUnion<Literals, Fallback>` - literals with autocomplete + string fallback\r\n- `SetRequired<T, K>` / `SetOptional<T, K>` - targeted field modifications\r\n- `Simplify<T>` - flatten complex intersection types in IDE tooltips\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport type { Opaque, PartialDeep, SetRequired } from 'type-fest';\r\n\r\n// Branded type (cleaner than manual approach)\r\ntype UserId = Opaque<string, 'UserId'>;\r\n\r\n// Deep partial for patch operations\r\ntype UserPatch = PartialDeep<User>;\r\n\r\n// Make specific fields required\r\ntype UserWithEmail = SetRequired<Partial<User>, 'email'>;\r\n```\r\n"}}
