Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, tilt commands | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Process management\n\nMultiple Claude Code sessions may run concurrently across different repos. Never use broad process kills that affect other sessions.\n\n**Forbidden:**\n- `pkill tilt`, `killall tilt`, `pkill node`, etc.\n- Any kill command without filtering by working directory or PID\n\n**Required approach:**\n1. Identify processes spawned from the current repo (check cwd, parent process, or port)\n2. Kill only the specific PID(s) belonging to this session\n3. If unable to isolate the target process, treat as **blocked** and ask the user\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\n# Good: kill by specific PID after identifying it\nlsof -i :10350 | grep LISTEN  # find process on your port\nkill <specific-pid>\n\n# Good: filter by working directory\npgrep -f \"tilt.*$(pwd)\"\n\n# Bad: kills all tilt processes across all sessions\npkill tilt\n```\n\nWhen restarting services (tilt, docker-compose, dev servers), always verify you're targeting only processes from your working directory.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# Canton Monorepo - Agent Entry\n\nConcise entry point for agents. Use progressive disclosure: start here, then open the specific `CLAUDE.md` or doc that matches your task.\n\n## Read This First\n- Consult debugging docs before guessing: `docs/canton-sql-reference.md`, `docs/canton-grpc-reference.md`, `docs/querying-active-contracts.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`.\n- Use `localnet` CLI (`localnet --help`) for auth, topology, and API Gateway helpers.\n- When interfacing with localnet, use the `localnet-toolkit` skill.\n- Preserve existing secrets and credentials.\n\n## Auth & Token Rules (canonical)\n- Ledger API/party contract queries **require user tokens (password grant)**; service tokens lack `actAs/readAs` and will fail.\n- Service tokens (`localnet-admin-api`) are for admin/topology; validator tokens (`localnet-validator`) are for UserManagement.\n- If unsure, read `docs/querying-active-contracts.md`, then `apps/localnet/CLAUDE.md` or `packages/localnet-toolkit/CLAUDE.md`.\n- For Ledger API command shapes/identifier formats, see `apps/api-gateway/CLAUDE.md` (\"Ledger API Command Formats\").\n\n## Canton gRPC TypeScript\nThis workspace uses `@0xsend/canton-client` and `@0xsend/canton-protobuf` for Canton node integration. See `node_modules/@0xsend/canton-client/README.md` for key generation, signing, interactive submission, and party onboarding patterns.\n\n## Localnet, Participants & Database Queries\nFor participant architecture, contract visibility rules, and database debugging: **read `apps/localnet/CLAUDE.md`**. This includes which participants host which parties, how to query contracts in each database, and examples like the Ping workflow.\n\n## Quick Start (dev)\n```bash\nyarn install\ntilt up\nopen http://localhost:3000  # Wallet\nopen http://localhost:8787  # API Gateway\n```\n\nPorts are dynamic; see `apps/localnet/CLAUDE.md`.\n\n## Workspace Map (progressive disclosure)\n- Core troubleshooting: `docs/troubleshooting.md`\n- Localnet (ports, tokens, resets): `apps/localnet/CLAUDE.md`\n- API Gateway (security, transfer-preapproval, multisig/D1): `apps/api-gateway/CLAUDE.md`\n- Web app (wallet UI, upgrade flows): `apps/web/CLAUDE.md`\n- Browser extension (SEND-77 controller, transport): `apps/webext/CLAUDE.md`\n- Playwright E2E (auth state reuse, no mocks): `apps/playwright/CLAUDE.md`\n- Localnet toolkit (CLI/SDK auth patterns): `packages/localnet-toolkit/CLAUDE.md`\n- dApp RPC package (OpenRPC schemas, transport): `packages/canton-dapp/CLAUDE.md`\n- Shared app package (Canton signing, upgrade utils): `packages/app/CLAUDE.md`\n- Merge automation service: `apps/merge-automation/CLAUDE.md`\n- Gas automation service: `apps/gas-automation/CLAUDE.md`\n\n## Testing & Verification\n- When applicable, validate across layers: API responses, Canton ledger state, and UI signals (`docs/querying-active-contracts.md` has patterns).\n- Use workspace tools before shipping: `yarn test`, `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck` (see app-specific CLAUDEs for variants).\n\n## When Stuck\n- Check existing logs before restarting services (e.g., `apps/web/web.log`, `apps/api-gateway/api-gateway.log`).\n- For Canton/network errors, go to `docs/troubleshooting.md` and the relevant app `CLAUDE.md` for reset/remediation steps.\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"exec","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"66b55cb238772f22a42e878311bf6a4def2feeae","branch":"dapp-support-alpha","repository_url":"git@github.com:0xsend/canton-monorepo.git"}}}

If unable to isolate the target process, treat as **blocked** and ask the user\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\n# Good: kill by specific PID after identifying it\nlsof -i :10350 | grep LISTEN  # find process on your port\nkill <specific-pid>\n\n# Good: filter by working directory\npgrep -f \"tilt.*$(pwd)\"\n\n# Bad: kills all tilt processes across all sessions\npkill tilt\n```\n\nWhen restarting services (tilt, docker-compose, dev servers), always verify you're targeting only processes from your working directory.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# Canton Monorepo - Agent Entry\n\nConcise entry point for agents. Use progressive disclosure: start here, then open the specific `CLAUDE.md` or doc that matches your task.\n\n## Read This First\n- Consult debugging docs before guessing: `docs/canton-sql-reference.md`, `docs/canton-grpc-reference.md`, `docs/querying-active-contracts.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`.\n- Use `localnet` CLI (`localnet --help`) for auth, topology, and API Gateway helpers.\n- When interfacing with localnet, use the `localnet-toolkit` skill.\n- Preserve existing secrets and credentials.\n\n## Auth & Token Rules (canonical)\n- Ledger API/party contract queries **require user tokens (password grant)**; service tokens lack `actAs/readAs` and will fail.\n- Service tokens (`localnet-admin-api`) are for admin/topology; validator tokens (`localnet-validator`) are for UserManagement.\n- If unsure, read `docs/querying-active-contracts.md`, then `apps/localnet/CLAUDE.md` or `packages/localnet-toolkit/CLAUDE.md`.\n- For Ledger API command shapes/identifier formats, see `apps/api-gateway/CLAUDE.md` (\"Ledger API Command Formats\").\n\n## Canton gRPC TypeScript\nThis workspace uses `@0xsend/canton-client` and `@0xsend/canton-protobuf` for Canton node integration. See `node_modules/@0xsend/canton-client/README.md` for key generation, signing, interactive submission, and party onboarding patterns.\n\n## Localnet, Participants & Database Queries\nFor participant architecture, contract visibility rules, and database debugging: **read `apps/localnet/CLAUDE.md`**. This includes which participants host which parties, how to query contracts in each database, and examples like the Ping workflow.\n\n## Quick Start (dev)\n```bash\nyarn install\ntilt up\nopen http://localhost:3000  # Wallet\nopen http://localhost:8787  # API Gateway\n```\n\nPorts are dynamic; see `apps/localnet/CLAUDE.md`.\n\n## Workspace Map (progressive disclosure)\n- Core troubleshooting: `docs/troubleshooting.md`\n- Localnet (ports, tokens, resets): `apps/localnet/CLAUDE.md`\n- API Gateway (security, transfer-preapproval, multisig/D1): `apps/api-gateway/CLAUDE.md`\n- Web app (wallet UI, upgrade flows): `apps/web/CLAUDE.md`\n- Browser extension (SEND-77 controller, transport): `apps/webext/CLAUDE.md`\n- Playwright E2E (auth state reuse, no mocks): `apps/playwright/CLAUDE.md`\n- Localnet toolkit (CLI/SDK auth patterns): `packages/localnet-toolkit/CLAUDE.md`\n- dApp RPC package (OpenRPC schemas, transport): `packages/canton-dapp/CLAUDE.md`\n- Shared app package (Canton signing, upgrade utils): `packages/app/CLAUDE.md`\n- Merge automation service: `apps/merge-automation/CLAUDE.md`\n- Gas automation service: `apps/gas-automation/CLAUDE.md`\n\n## Testing & Verification\n- When applicable, validate across layers: API responses, Canton ledger state, and UI signals (`docs/querying-active-contracts.md` has patterns).\n- Use workspace tools before shipping: `yarn test`, `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck` (see app-specific CLAUDEs for variants).\n\n## When Stuck\n- Check existing logs before restarting services (e.g., `apps/web/web.log`, `apps/api-gateway/api-gateway.log`).\n- For Canton/network errors, go to `docs/troubleshooting.md` and the relevant app `CLAUDE.md` for reset/remediation steps.\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Compare Browser Keys with Canton Topology\r\n\r\nExport `canton-keys` from browser IndexedDB, then:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nlocalnet topology list-keys \\\r\n  --party \"cantonwallet-username::1220...\" \\\r\n  --compare canton-keys.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nShows which keys exist in topology vs IndexedDB and highlights mismatches.\r\n\r\n### 3. Debug 401 Errors on API Gateway\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# First, check if user exists\r\nlocalnet keycloak list-users\r\n\r\n# Then test with that user\r\nlocalnet api-gateway GET /canton/ledger-api/party/portfolio --as alice-w0-v1 -v\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Test Transfer Preapproval Flow\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Check if preapproval exists\r\nlocalnet api-gateway GET /canton/party/transfer-preapproval/check --as alice-w0-v1\r\n\r\n# Get preapproval config\r\nlocalnet api-gateway GET /canton/party/transfer-preapproval/config --as alice-w0-v1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5. Query Party Keys via API Gateway\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Get authorized signing keys for a party\r\nlocalnet api-gateway GET \"/canton/topology/party/cantonwallet-alice%3A%3A1220.../keys\" --as alice-w0-v1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Party ID must be URL-encoded (`::` becomes `%3A%3A`).\r\n\r\n## Token Types\r\n\r\n| Token Type | Use Case | How to Get |\r\n|------------|----------|------------|\r\n| User Token | Ledger API (party queries) | `localnet auth token --user <u> --password <p>` |\r\n| Service Token | Admin API (topology) | `localnet auth service --client-id <id> --secret <s>` |\r\n| Validator Token | UserManagementService | `localnet auth service --client-id localnet-validator --secret localnet-validator-secret` |\r\n\r\n**Critical**: Service tokens CANNOT query Ledger API - they lack `actAs`/`readAs` claims.\r\n\r\n## Error Handling\r\n\r\n| Error | Cause | Fix |\r\n|-------|-------|-----|\r\n| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid/expired token | Use `--as <user>` for auto-auth |\r\n| `No users found` | Localnet not running | Run `tilt up` |\r\n| `fetch failed` | API Gateway down | Check `curl http://localhost:8787/health` |\r\n| Party not found | Party not onboarded | Use `localnet topology verify` |\r\n\r\n## Tilt Log Files\r\n\r\nCheck these logs when debugging:\r\n- `apps/api-gateway/api-gateway.log` - API Gateway output\r\n- `apps/web/web.log` - Next.js web app output\r\n"}}

Must use when writing or modifying Playwright tests (.spec.ts, .test.ts files with @playwright/test imports).\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Playwright Best Practices\r\n\r\n## Locator Priority (Most to Least Resilient)\r\n\r\nAlways prefer user-facing attributes:\r\n\r\n1. `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })` - accessibility roles\r\n2. `page.getByLabel('Email')` - form control labels\r\n3. `page.getByPlaceholder('Search...')` - input placeholders\r\n4. `page.getByText('Welcome')` - visible text (non-interactive)\r\n5. `page.getByAltText('Logo')` - image alt text\r\n6. `page.getByTitle('Settings')` - title attributes\r\n7. `page.getByTestId('submit-btn')` - explicit test contracts\r\n8. CSS/XPath - last resort, avoid\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// BAD: Brittle selectors tied to implementation\r\npage.locator('button.btn-primary.submit-form')\r\npage.locator('//div[@class=\"container\"]/form/button')\r\npage.locator('#app > div:nth-child(2) > button')\r\n\r\n// GOOD: User-facing, resilient locators\r\npage.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })\r\npage.getByLabel('Password')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Chaining and Filtering\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Scope within a region\r\nconst card = page.getByRole('listitem').filter({ hasText: 'Product A' });\r\nawait card.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' }).click();\r\n\r\n// Filter by child locator\r\nconst row = page.getByRole('row').filter({\r\n  has: page.getByRole('cell', { name: 'John' })\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Combine conditions\r\nconst visibleSubmit = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).and(page.locator(':visible'));\r\nconst primaryOrSecondary = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' }).or(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Update' }));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Strictness\r\n\r\nLocators throw if multiple elements match. Use `first()`, `last()`, `nth()` only when intentional:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Throws if multiple buttons match\r\nawait page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Delete' }).click();\r\n\r\n// Explicit selection when needed\r\nawait page.getByRole('listitem').first().click();\r\nawait page.getByRole('row').nth(2).getByRole('button').click();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Web-First Assertions\r\n\r\nUse async assertions that auto-wait and retry:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// BAD: No auto-wait, flaky\r\nexpect(await page.getByText('Success').isVisible()).toBe(true);\r\n\r\n// GOOD: Auto-waits up to timeout\r\nawait expect(page.getByText('Success')).toBeVisible();\r\nawait expect(page.getByRole('button')).toBeEnabled();\r\nawait expect(page.getByTestId('status')).toHaveText('Submitted');\r\nawait expect(page).toHaveURL(/dashboard/);\r\nawait expect(page).toHaveTitle('Dashboard');\r\n\r\n// Collections\r\nawait expect(page.getByRole('listitem')).toHaveCount(5);\r\nawait expect(page.getByRole('listitem')).toHaveText(['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']);\r\n\r\n// Soft assertions (continue on failure, report all)\r\nawait expect.soft(locator).toBeVisible();\r\nawait expect.soft(locator).toHaveText('Expected');\r\n// Test continues, failures compiled at end\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Page Object Model\r\n\r\nEncapsulate page interactions. Define locators as readonly properties in constructor.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// pages/base.page.ts\r\nimport { type Page, type Locator, expect } from '@playwright/test';\r\nimport debug from 'debug';\r\n\r\nexport abstract class BasePage {\r\n  protected readonly log: debug.Debugger;\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    protected readonly page: Page,\r\n    protected readonly timeout = 30_000\r\n  ) {\r\n    this.log = debug(`test:page:${this.constructor.name}`);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  protected async safeClick(locator: Locator, description?: string) {\r\n    this.log('clicking: %s', description ?? locator);\r\n    await expect(locator).toBeVisible({ timeout: this.timeout });\r\n    await expect(locator).toBeEnabled({ timeout: this.timeout });\r\n    await locator.click();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  protected async safeFill(locator: Locator, value: string) {\r\n    await expect(locator).toBeVisible({ timeout: this.timeout });\r\n    await locator.fill(value);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  abstract isLoaded(): Promise<void>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// pages/login.page.ts\r\nimport { type Locator, type Page, expect } from '@playwright/test';\r\nimport { BasePage } from './base.page';\r\n\r\nexport class LoginPage extends BasePage {\r\n  readonly emailInput: Locator;\r\n  readonly passwordInput: Locator;\r\n  readonly submitButton: Locator;\r\n  readonly errorMessage: Locator;\r\n\r\n  constructor(page: Page) {\r\n    super(page);\r\n    this.emailInput = page.getByLabel('Email');\r\n    this.passwordInput = page.getByLabel('Password');\r\n    this.submitButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' });\r\n    this.errorMessage = page.getByRole('alert');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  async goto() {\r\n    await this.page.goto('/login');\r\n    await this.isLoaded();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  async isLoaded() {\r\n    await expect(this.emailInput).toBeVisible();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  async login(email: string, password: string) {\r\n    await this.safeFill(this.emailInput, email);\r\n    await this.safeFill(this.passwordInput, password);\r\n    await this.safeClick(this.submitButton, 'Sign in button');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  async expectError(message: string) {\r\n    await expect(this.errorMessage).toHaveText(message);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fixtures\r\n\r\nPrefer fixtures over beforeEach/afterEach. Fixtures encapsulate setup + teardown, run on-demand, and compose with dependencies.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// fixtures/index.ts\r\nimport { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';\r\nimport { LoginPage } from '../pages/login.page';\r\nimport { DashboardPage } from '../pages/dashboard.page';\r\n\r\ntype TestFixtures = {\r\n  loginPage: LoginPage;\r\n  dashboardPage: DashboardPage;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const test = base.extend<TestFixtures>({\r\n  loginPage: async ({ page }, use) => {\r\n    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);\r\n    await loginPage.goto();\r\n    await use(loginPage);\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  dashboardPage: async ({ page }, use) => {\r\n    await use(new DashboardPage(page));\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport { expect };\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Worker-Scoped Fixtures\r\n\r\nUse for expensive setup shared across tests (database connections, authenticated users):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// fixtures/auth.fixture.ts\r\nimport { test as base } from '@playwright/test';\r\n\r\ntype WorkerFixtures = {\r\n  authenticatedUser: { token: string; userId: string };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const test = base.extend<{}, WorkerFixtures>({\r\n  authenticatedUser: [async ({}, use) => {\r\n    // Expensive setup - runs once per worker\r\n    const user = await createTestUser();\r\n    const token = await authenticateUser(user);\r\n\r\n    await use({ token, userId: user.id });\r\n\r\n    // Cleanup after all tests in worker\r\n    await deleteTestUser(user.id);\r\n  }, { scope: 'worker' }],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Automatic Fixtures\r\n\r\nRun for every test without explicit declaration:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const test = base.extend<{ autoLog: void }>({\r\n  autoLog: [async ({ page }, use) => {\r\n    page.on('console', msg => console.log(`[browser] ${msg.text()}`));\r\n    await use();\r\n  }, { auto: true }],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\n\r\nSave authenticated state to reuse. Never log in via UI in every test.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// auth.setup.ts\r\nimport { test as setup, expect } from '@playwright/test';\r\n\r\nconst authFile = 'playwright/.auth/user.json';\r\n\r\nsetup('authenticate', async ({ page }) => {\r\n  await page.goto('/login');\r\n  await page.getByLabel('Email').fill(process.env.TEST_USER_EMAIL!);\r\n  await page.getByLabel('Password').fill(process.env.TEST_USER_PASSWORD!);\r\n  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();\r\n  await page.waitForURL('/dashboard');\r\n  await page.context().storageState({ path: authFile });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// playwright.config.ts\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n  projects: [\r\n    { name: 'setup', testMatch: /.*\\.setup\\.ts/ },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'chromium',\r\n      use: {\r\n        ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],\r\n        storageState: 'playwright/.auth/user.json',\r\n      },\r\n      dependencies: ['setup'],\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### API Authentication (Faster)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nsetup('authenticate via API', async ({ request }) => {\r\n  const response = await request.post('/api/auth/login', {\r\n    data: { email: process.env.TEST_USER_EMAIL, password: process.env.TEST_USER_PASSWORD },\r\n  });\r\n  expect(response.ok()).toBeTruthy();\r\n  await request.storageState({ path: authFile });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Network Mocking\r\n\r\nSet up routes before navigation.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntest('displays mocked data', async ({ page }) => {\r\n  await page.route('**/api/users', route => route.fulfill({\r\n    json: [{ id: 1, name: 'Test User' }],\r\n  }));\r\n\r\n  await page.goto('/users');\r\n  await expect(page.getByText('Test User')).toBeVisible();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Modify real response\r\ntest('injects item into response', async ({ page }) => {\r\n  await page.route('**/api/items', async route => {\r\n    const response = await route.fetch();\r\n    const json = await response.json();\r\n    json.push({ id: 999, name: 'Injected' });\r\n    await route.fulfill({ response, json });\r\n  });\r\n  await page.goto('/items');\r\n});\r\n\r\n// HAR recording\r\ntest('uses recorded responses', async ({ page }) => {\r\n  await page.routeFromHAR('./fixtures/api.har', {\r\n    url: '**/api/**',\r\n    update: false, // true to record\r\n  });\r\n  await page.goto('/');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test Isolation\r\n\r\nEach test gets fresh browser context. Never share state between tests.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// BAD: Tests depend on each other\r\nlet userId: string;\r\ntest('create user', async ({ request }) => {\r\n  userId = (await (await request.post('/api/users', { data: { name: 'Test' } })).json()).id;\r\n});\r\ntest('delete user', async ({ request }) => {\r\n  await request.delete(`/api/users/${userId}`); // Depends on previous!\r\n});\r\n\r\n// GOOD: Each test creates its own data\r\ntest('can delete created user', async ({ request }) => {\r\n  const { id } = await (await request.post('/api/users', { data: { name: 'Test' } })).json();\r\n  const deleteResponse = await request.delete(`/api/users/${id}`);\r\n  expect(deleteResponse.ok()).toBeTruthy();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// playwright.config.ts\r\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\r\n\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n  testDir: './tests',\r\n  fullyParallel: true,\r\n  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,\r\n  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,\r\n  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,\r\n  reporter: process.env.CI ?
