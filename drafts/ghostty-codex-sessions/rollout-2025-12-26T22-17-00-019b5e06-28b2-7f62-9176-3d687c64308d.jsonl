Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, tilt commands | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# Agent Development Guide\n\nA file for [guiding coding agents](https://agents.md/).\n\n## Commands\n\n- **Build:** `zig build`\n- **Test (Zig):** `zig build test`\n- **Test filter (Zig)**: `zig build test -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- **Formatting (Zig)**: `zig fmt .`\n- **Formatting (other)**: `prettier -w .`\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n- Shared Zig core: `src/`\n- C API: `include`\n- macOS app: `macos/`\n- GTK (Linux and FreeBSD) app: `src/apprt/gtk`\n\n## libghostty-vt\n\n- Build: `zig build lib-vt`\n- Build Wasm Module: `zig build lib-vt -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding`\n- Test: `zig build test-lib-vt`\n- Test filter: `zig build test-lib-vt -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- When working on libghostty-vt, do not build the full app.\n- For C only changes, don't run the Zig tests.

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"465d284c0d1d9131443517cb0ead695089b9a6c3","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:ghostty-org/ghostty.git"}}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Must use when reading or writing Zig files.\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Zig Best Practices\r\n\r\n## Type-First Development\r\n\r\nTypes define the contract before implementation. Follow this workflow:\r\n\r\n1. **Define data structures** - structs, unions, and error sets first\r\n2. **Define function signatures** - parameters, return types, and error unions\r\n3. **Implement to satisfy types** - let the compiler guide completeness\r\n4. **Validate at comptime** - catch invalid configurations during compilation\r\n\r\n### Make Illegal States Unrepresentable\r\n\r\nUse Zig's type system to prevent invalid states at compile time.\r\n\r\n**Tagged unions for mutually exclusive states:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: only valid combinations possible\r\nconst RequestState = union(enum) {\r\n    idle,\r\n    loading,\r\n    success: []const u8,\r\n    failure: anyerror,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn handleState(state: RequestState) void {\r\n    switch (state) {\r\n        .idle => {},\r\n        .loading => showSpinner(),\r\n        .success => |data| render(data),\r\n        .failure => |err| showError(err),\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: allows invalid combinations\r\nconst RequestState = struct {\r\n    loading: bool,\r\n    data: ?[]const u8,\r\n    err: ?anyerror,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explicit error sets for failure modes:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: documents exactly what can fail\r\nconst ParseError = error{\r\n    InvalidSyntax,\r\n    UnexpectedToken,\r\n    EndOfInput,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) ParseError!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: anyerror hides failure modes\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) anyerror!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Distinct types for domain concepts:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Prevent mixing up IDs of different types\r\nconst UserId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\nconst OrderId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\n\r\nfn getUser(id: UserId) !User {\r\n    // Compiler prevents passing OrderId here\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn createUserId(raw: u64) UserId {\r\n    return @enumFromInt(raw);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Comptime validation for invariants:**\r\n```zig\r\nfn Buffer(comptime size: usize) type {\r\n    if (size == 0) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size must be greater than 0\");\r\n    }\r\n    if (size > 1024 * 1024) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size exceeds 1MB limit\");\r\n    }\r\n    return struct {\r\n        data: [size]u8 = undefined,\r\n        len: usize = 0,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Non-exhaustive enums for extensibility:**\r\n```zig\r\n// External enum that may gain variants\r\nconst Status = enum(u8) {\r\n    active = 1,\r\n    inactive = 2,\r\n    pending = 3,\r\n    _,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn processStatus(status: Status) !void {\r\n    switch (status) {\r\n        .active => {},\r\n        .inactive => {},\r\n        .pending => {},\r\n        _ => return error.UnknownStatus,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Module Structure\r\n\r\nLarger cohesive files are idiomatic in Zig. Keep related code together: tests alongside implementation, comptime generics at file scope, public/private controlled by `pub`. Split only when a file handles genuinely separate concerns. The standard library demonstrates this pattern with files like `std/mem.zig` containing 2000+ lines of cohesive memory operations.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n- Return errors with context using error unions (`!T`); every function returns a value or an error. Explicit error sets document failure modes.\r\n- Use `errdefer` for cleanup on error paths; use `defer` for unconditional cleanup. This prevents resource leaks without try-finally boilerplate.\r\n- Handle all branches in `switch` statements; include an `else` clause that returns an error or uses `unreachable` for truly impossible cases.\r\n- Pass allocators explicitly to functions requiring dynamic memory; prefer `std.testing.allocator` in tests for leak detection.\r\n- Prefer `const` over `var`; prefer slices over raw pointers for bounds safety. Immutability signals intent and enables optimizations.\r\n- Avoid `anytype`; prefer explicit `comptime T: type` parameters. Explicit types document intent and produce clearer error messages.\r\n- Use `std.log.scoped` for namespaced logging; define a module-level `log` constant for consistent scope across the file.\r\n- Add or update tests for new logic; use `std.testing.allocator` to catch memory leaks automatically.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nExplicit failure for unimplemented logic:\r\n```zig\r\nfn buildWidget(widget_type: []const u8) !Widget {\r\n    return error.NotImplemented;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPropagate errors with try:\r\n```zig\r\nfn readConfig(path: []const u8) !Config {\r\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(path, .{});\r\n    defer file.close();\r\n    const contents = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, max_size);\r\n    return parseConfig(contents);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResource cleanup with errdefer:\r\n```zig\r\nfn createResource(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !*Resource {\r\n    const resource = try allocator.create(Resource);\r\n    errdefer allocator.destroy(resource);\r\n\r\n    resource.* = try initializeResource();\r\n    return resource;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExhaustive switch with explicit default:\r\n```zig\r\nfn processStatus(status: Status) ![]const u8 {\r\n    return switch (status) {\r\n        .active => \"processing\",\r\n        .inactive => \"skipped\",\r\n        _ => error.UnhandledStatus,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTesting with memory leak detection:\r\n```zig\r\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\r\n\r\ntest \"widget creation\" {\r\n    const allocator = std.testing.allocator;\r\n    var list: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(u32) = .empty;\r\n    defer list.deinit(allocator);\r\n\r\n    try list.append(allocator, 42);\r\n    try std.testing.expectEqual(1, list.items.len);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Memory Management\r\n\r\n- Pass allocators explicitly; never use global state for allocation. Functions declare their allocation needs in parameters.\r\n- Use `defer` immediately after acquiring a resource. Place cleanup logic next to acquisition for clarity.\r\n- Prefer arena allocators for temporary allocations; they free everything at once when the arena is destroyed.\r\n- Use `std.testing.allocator` in tests; it reports leaks with stack traces showing allocation origins.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nAllocator as explicit parameter:\r\n```zig\r\nfn processData(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, input: []const u8) ![]u8 {\r\n    const result = try allocator.alloc(u8, input.len * 2);\r\n    errdefer allocator.free(result);\r\n\r\n    // process input into result\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nArena allocator for batch operations:\r\n```zig\r\nfn processBatch(items: []const Item) !void {\r\n    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);\r\n    defer arena.deinit();\r\n    const allocator = arena.allocator();\r\n\r\n    for (items) |item| {\r\n        const processed = try processItem(allocator, item);\r\n        try outputResult(processed);\r\n    }\r\n    // All allocations freed when arena deinits\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Logging\r\n\r\n- Use `std.log.scoped` to create namespaced loggers; each module should define its own scoped logger for filtering.\r\n- Define a module-level `const log` at the top of the file; use it consistently throughout the module.\r\n- Use appropriate log levels: `err` for failures, `warn` for suspicious conditions, `info` for state changes, `debug` for tracing.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nScoped logger for a module:\r\n```zig\r\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.widgets);\r\n\r\npub fn createWidget(name: []const u8) !Widget {\r\n    log.debug(\"creating widget: {s}\", .{name});\r\n    const widget = try allocateWidget(name);\r\n    log.debug(\"created widget id={d}\", .{widget.id});\r\n    return widget;\r\n}\r\n\r\npub fn deleteWidget(id: u32) void {\r\n    log.info(\"deleting widget id={d}\", .{id});\r\n    // cleanup\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMultiple scopes in a codebase:\r\n```zig\r\n// In src/db.zig\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.db);\r\n\r\n// In src/http.zig\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.http);\r\n\r\n// In src/auth.zig\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.auth);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Comptime Patterns\r\n\r\n- Use `comptime` parameters for generic functions; type information is available at compile time with zero runtime cost.\r\n- Prefer compile-time validation over runtime checks when possible. Catch errors during compilation rather than in production.\r\n- Use `@compileError` for invalid configurations that should fail the build.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nGeneric function with comptime type:\r\n```zig\r\nfn max(comptime T: type, a: T, b: T) T {\r\n    return if (a > b) a else b;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompile-time validation:\r\n```zig\r\nfn createBuffer(comptime size: usize) [size]u8 {\r\n    if (size == 0) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size must be greater than 0\");\r\n    }\r\n    return [_]u8{0} ** size;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Avoiding anytype\r\n\r\n- Prefer `comptime T: type` over `anytype`; explicit type parameters document expected constraints and produce clearer errors.\r\n- Use `anytype` only when the function genuinely accepts any type (like `std.debug.print`) or for callbacks/closures.\r\n- When using `anytype`, add a doc comment describing the expected interface or constraints.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nPrefer explicit comptime type (good):\r\n```zig\r\nfn sum(comptime T: type, items: []const T) T {\r\n    var total: T = 0;\r\n    for (items) |item| {\r\n        total += item;\r\n    }\r\n    return total;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAvoid anytype when type is known (bad):\r\n```zig\r\n// Unclear what types are valid; error messages will be confusing\r\nfn sum(items: anytype) @TypeOf(items[0]) {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAcceptable anytype for callbacks:\r\n```zig\r\n/// Calls `callback` for each item. Callback must accept (T) and return void.\r\nfn forEach(comptime T: type, items: []const T, callback: anytype) void {\r\n    for (items) |item| {\r\n        callback(item);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing @TypeOf when anytype is necessary:\r\n```zig\r\nfn debugPrint(value: anytype) void {\r\n    const T = @TypeOf(value);\r\n    if (@typeInfo(T) == .Pointer) {\r\n        std.debug.print(\"ptr: {*}\\n\", .{value});\r\n    } else {\r\n        std.debug.print(\"val: {}\\n\", .{value});\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Error Handling Patterns\r\n\r\n- Define specific error sets for functions; avoid `anyerror` when possible. Specific errors document failure modes.\r\n- Use `catch` with a block for error recovery or logging; use `catch unreachable` only when errors are truly impossible.\r\n- Merge error sets with `||` when combining operations that can fail in different ways.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nSpecific error set:\r\n```zig\r\nconst ConfigError = error{\r\n    FileNotFound,\r\n    ParseError,\r\n    InvalidFormat,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn loadConfig(path: []const u8) ConfigError!Config {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nError handling with catch block:\r\n```zig\r\nconst value = operation() catch |err| {\r\n    std.log.err(\"operation failed: {}\", .{err});\r\n    return error.OperationFailed;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n- Load config from environment variables at startup; validate required values before use. Missing config should cause a clean exit with a descriptive message.\r\n- Define a Config struct as single source of truth; avoid `std.posix.getenv` scattered throughout code.\r\n- Use sensible defaults for development; require explicit values for production secrets.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nTyped config struct:\r\n```zig\r\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\r\n\r\npub const Config = struct {\r\n    port: u16,\r\n    database_url: []const u8,\r\n    api_key: []const u8,\r\n    env: []const u8,\r\n};\r\n\r\npub fn loadConfig() !Config {\r\n    const db_url = std.posix.getenv(\"DATABASE_URL\") orelse\r\n        return error.MissingDatabaseUrl;\r\n    const api_key = std.posix.getenv(\"API_KEY\") orelse\r\n        return error.MissingApiKey;\r\n    const port_str = std.posix.getenv(\"PORT\") orelse \"3000\";\r\n    const port = std.fmt.parseInt(u16, port_str, 10) catch\r\n        return error.InvalidPort;\r\n\r\n    return .{\r\n        .port = port,\r\n        .database_url = db_url,\r\n        .api_key = api_key,\r\n        .env = std.posix.getenv(\"ENV\") orelse \"development\",\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Optionals\r\n\r\n- Use `orelse` to provide default values for optionals; use `.?` only when null is a program error.\r\n- Prefer `if (optional) |value|` pattern for safe unwrapping with access to the value.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nSafe optional handling:\r\n```zig\r\nfn findWidget(id: u32) ?*Widget {\r\n    // lookup implementation\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn processWidget(id: u32) !void {\r\n    const widget = findWidget(id) orelse return error.WidgetNotFound;\r\n    try widget.process();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptional with if unwrapping:\r\n```zig\r\nif (maybeValue) |value| {\r\n    try processValue(value);\r\n} else {\r\n    std.log.warn(\"no value present\", .{});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Advanced Topics\r\n\r\nReference these guides for specialized patterns:\r\n\r\n- **Building custom containers** (queues, stacks, trees): See [GENERICS.md](GENERICS.md)\r\n- **Interfacing with C libraries** (raylib, SDL, curl, system APIs): See [C-INTEROP.md](C-INTEROP.md)\r\n- **Debugging memory leaks** (GPA, stack traces): See [DEBUGGING.md](DEBUGGING.md)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- Language Reference: https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.2/\r\n- Standard Library: https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.2/std/\r\n- Code Samples: https://ziglang.org/learn/samples/\r\n- Zig Guide: https://zig.guide/\r\n"}}

Add viewport clamping after row-shrink and after resizeCols to ensure\r\n      the viewport pin is always in a valid position\r\n    - Make getTopLeft(.viewport) validate the pin and fall back to active\r\n      if invalid, ensuring consistency with getBottomRight\r\n    - Add screen-bottom fallback in getBottomRight as ultimate safety\r\n    - Guard against zero-size viewport (rows == 0) to prevent underflow\r\n    - Add three regression tests covering the crash scenarios\r\n    \r\n    Known limitation: viewportRowOffset may briefly show a stale scrollbar\r\n    position after resize/reflow until a later clamp operation, because\r\n    adding validation there breaks expected behavior (both pinIsActive and\r\n    down() give incorrect results when page structure changes).\r\n    \r\n    Fixes crash reported in bug-crash-reports/2025-12-26/REPORT.md\r\n\r\n\u001b[1mdiff --git a/src/global.zig b/src/global.zig\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[1mindex 89eca4521..29eaf5f36 100644\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[1m--- a/src/global.zig\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[1m+++ b/src/global.zig\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[36m@@ -127,7 +127,6 @@\u001b[m \u001b[mpub const GlobalState = struct {\u001b[m\r\n \u001b[m\r\n         // Output some debug information right away\u001b[m\r\n         std.log.info(\"ghostty version={s}\", .{build_config.version_string});\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-        std.log.info(\"LOCAL BUILD: unreachable instrumentation enabled\", .{});\u001b[m\r\n         std.log.info(\"ghostty build optimize={s}\", .{build_config.mode_string});\u001b[m\r\n         std.log.info(\"runtime={}\", .{build_config.app_runtime});\u001b[m\r\n         std.log.info(\"font_backend={}\", .{build_config.font_backend});\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[1mdiff --git a/src/renderer/generic.zig b/src/renderer/generic.zig\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[1mindex 7d20286b8..4ebe501f7 100644\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[1m--- a/src/renderer/generic.zig\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[1m+++ b/src/renderer/generic.zig\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[36m@@ -1832,12 +1832,6 @@\u001b[m \u001b[mpub fn Renderer(comptime GraphicsAPI: type) type {\u001b[m\r\n                 // only ever be looking at virtual placements that are in our\u001b[m\r\n                 // viewport in the renderer and virtual placements only ever take\u001b[m\r\n                 // up one row.\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                log.err(\"BUG: virtual placement pin outside viewport image_id={} placement_id={} pin.x={} pin.y={}\", .{\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                    p.image_id,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                    p.placement_id,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                    rp.top_left.x,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                    rp.top_left.y,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                });\u001b[m\r\n                 unreachable;\u001b[m\r\n             };\u001b[m\r\n \u001b[m\r\n\u001b[36m@@ -1903,24 +1897,6 @@\u001b[m \u001b[mpub fn Renderer(comptime GraphicsAPI: type) type {\u001b[m\r\n                 image.height;\u001b[m\r\n \u001b[m\r\n             // Get the viewport-relative Y position of the placement.\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-            const i32_max_u32: u32 = @intCast(std.math.maxInt(i32));\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-            if (img_top_y > i32_max_u32 or img_bot_y > i32_max_u32 or\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                top_y > i32_max_u32 or bot_y > i32_max_u32)\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-            {\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                log.warn(\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                    \"kitty placement y overflow risk image_id={} img_top_y={} img_bot_y={} top_y={} bot_y={} rect_top_y={} rect_bot_y={} z={}\",\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                    .{\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                        image.id,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                        img_top_y,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                        img_bot_y,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                        top_y,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                        bot_y,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                        rect.top_left.y,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                        rect.bottom_right.y,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                        p.z,\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                    },\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-                );\u001b[m\r\n\u001b[31m-            }\u001b[m\r\n             const y_pos: i32 = @as(i32, @intCast(img_top_y)) -
