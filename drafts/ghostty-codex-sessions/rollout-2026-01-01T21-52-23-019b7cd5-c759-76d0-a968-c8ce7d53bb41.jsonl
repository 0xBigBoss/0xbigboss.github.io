Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, `tilt` CLI, tilt process management | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Process management\n\nLoad the `tilt` skill before running tilt CLI commands or managing tilt processes.\n\nMultiple Claude Code sessions may run concurrently across different repos. Never use broad process kills that affect other sessions.\n\n**Forbidden:**\n- `pkill tilt`, `killall tilt`, `pkill node`, etc.\n- Any kill command without filtering by working directory or PID\n\n**Required approach:**\n1. Identify processes spawned from the current repo (check cwd, parent process, or port)\n2. Kill only the specific PID(s) belonging to this session\n3. If unable to isolate the target process, treat as **blocked** and ask the user\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\n# Good: kill by specific PID after identifying it\nlsof -i :10350 | grep LISTEN  # find process on your port\nkill <specific-pid>\n\n# Good: filter by working directory\npgrep -f \"tilt.*$(pwd)\"\n\n# Bad: kills all tilt processes across all sessions\npkill tilt\n```\n\nWhen restarting services (tilt, docker-compose, dev servers), always verify you're targeting only processes from your working directory.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"exec","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"e391aed45d903e78f3fca5eca3cbc78ba53a8788","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:0xBigBoss/0xbigboss.github.io.git"}}}

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

The skill is at `~/0xbigboss/ghostty/.claude/skills/ghostty-crash-triage/`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- The term \"slop\" refers to low-quality AI-generated content dumped without thought\r\n- Mitchell emphasizes the *human* skills as much as the AI driving skills\r\n- The ask-first approach was critical to acceptance\r\n"}}

Focus on the viewport row\r\niteration null unwrap and verify the new instrumentation logs.\r\n</role>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key insight:** AI sessions are stateless. Explicit handoffs bridge context across conversations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 2: Investigation Workflow\r\n\r\n### The Iteration Loop\r\n\r\n```\r\nhypothesis → instrumentation → build → test → analyze → refine\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example cycle:**\r\n1. Identify candidate `unreachable` statements\r\n2. Add logging instrumentation to each\r\n3. Build with `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe`\r\n4. Run and trigger crash\r\n5. Analyze logs to narrow down\r\n6. Repeat with refined hypothesis\r\n\r\n### Multi-Layer Verification\r\n\r\n1. **Syntax check:** AI runs `zig ast-check` before claiming changes valid\r\n2. **Build verification:** Compile to catch errors\r\n3. **Startup marker:** Look for \"LOCAL BUILD\" in logs\r\n4. **Log stream:** `sudo log stream --predicate 'subsystem==\"com.mitchellh.ghostty\"' | grep \"LOCAL BUILD|BUG:\"`\r\n\r\n### Critical Lesson: Wrong Binary\r\n\r\nThe AI caught a major mistake:\r\n\r\n> \"That crash was from the **old Ghostty** (version 1.3.0-main+e515d0847), not your local build. There's no 'LOCAL BUILD' marker in the logs.\"\r\n\r\nThe startup marker pattern proved essential for distinguishing builds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 3: Domain Translation\r\n\r\n### Treating AI as Subject Matter Expert\r\n\r\nInstead of learning Zig/Metal/terminals, asked questions at the right abstraction level:\r\n\r\n- \"Is there a way to build only the version I need for Mac?\"\r\n- \"Will this build get us closer to the root cause?\"\r\n- \"I'm already running one version of Ghostty - will they interfere?\"\r\n\r\n### Building Mental Models Through AI\r\n\r\nAsked for explanations to understand the codebase:\r\n\r\n> \"Look at the recent linkCells fix in the git log. Trace through the ghostty code and explain high level the architecture and why the OOB crash is even possible.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 4: Tools Built\r\n\r\n> **Note:** These tools were created in the **ghostty repo** (`~/0xbigboss/ghostty/`) during the investigation, not in this blog repo. They are documented here for reference.\r\n\r\n### ghostty-crash-triage Skill\r\n\r\nOne-command orchestrator for crash analysis, located at `~/0xbigboss/ghostty/.claude/skills/ghostty-crash-triage/`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/0xbigboss/ghostty/.claude/skills/ghostty-crash-triage/\r\n├── SKILL.md\r\n├── scripts/\r\n│   ├── triage.py              # Main orchestrator\r\n│   ├── extract_sentry_envelope.py\r\n│   └── lldb_bt.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What it does:**\r\n1.

Viewport Overflow Panic (`getBottomRight`)\r\n- **File:** `src/terminal/PageList.zig:3980`\r\n- **Root cause:** After resize, viewport pin positioned past valid bounds\r\n- **Arithmetic:** `rows=76, total_rows=116, pin.y=46` → `46+75=121 > 115`\r\n\r\n### 2. Integer Underflow in CircBuf (`getPtrSlice`)\r\n- **File:** `src/datastruct/CircBuf.zig`\r\n- **Root cause:** Zero-length slice requests caused underflow\r\n\r\n### 3. linkCells Out-of-Bounds\r\n- **File:** `src/terminal/render.zig`\r\n- **Root cause:** Viewport-relative y coords passed where page-relative expected\r\n\r\n### 4. Virtual Placement Pin Outside Viewport\r\n- **File:** `src/renderer/generic.zig:1835`\r\n- **Root cause:** Viewport bounds captured but changed before use\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 6: Key Quotes for Blog\r\n\r\n### On Hypothesis Formation\r\n> \"**Hypothesis**: During window resize on macOS Tahoe, there's a timing issue where... the pin is no longer within the viewport bounds by the time `pointFromPin(.viewport, pin)` is called.\"\r\n\r\n### On User Agency\r\n> \"Will this build get us closer to the root cause? Let's try with symbols enabled. I am willing to pay the performance cost.\"\r\n\r\n### On Instrumentation Strategy\r\n> \"Instrument all potential crash sites rather than betting on a single hypothesis.\"\r\n\r\n### On Progress Without Resolution\r\n> \"When the crash happens, you'll get exact file:line info... This will definitively tell us which unreachable is being hit.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 7: Patterns Summary\r\n\r\n| Pattern | Implementation |\r\n|---------|----------------|\r\n| **Explicit role framing** | XML tags with role, context, state |\r\n| **State preservation** | `/handoff` prompts with Done/In-progress |\r\n| **Hypothesis-driven iteration** | Instrument → build → test → analyze |\r\n| **Domain abstraction** | Ask \"how do I run it\" vs. reading docs |\r\n| **Multi-layer verification** | Syntax → build → marker → log stream |\r\n| **Atomic task decomposition** | Numbered steps in prompts |\r\n| **Subagent delegation** | Parallel investigations |\r\n| **Reusable skills** | `ghostty-crash-triage` command |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Meta-Insight\r\n\r\n\"Driving AI with expert skill\" is less about domain expertise and more about:\r\n\r\n1. **Framing problems clearly** with structured prompts\r\n2. **Breaking complex tasks** into verifiable steps\r\n3. **Treating AI as domain expert** while controlling strategy\r\n4. **Building feedback loops** that confirm real progress\r\n5. **Creating reusable abstractions** for recurring patterns\r\n\r\nThe human brings: problem framing, verification, persistence, and social navigation.\r\nThe AI brings: domain knowledge, systematic search, code analysis, and tireless execution.\r\n"}}

This will help me assess if the blog post and its tooling are truly complete and ready."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpV0EtEvTkHmbU7fIT2HoljElTSXGZSPS0uPKwO4nekrj3lJ2L3c0Tki-L2gapKNIBaVVe5w0S-KTCQWw8wwvcVCft7MdhrJdYlv5ommgwt8Wz1chQTzjK-ZYQGiaHXgm-hkv3VtWun_8XsHCpRmHhFAkwNBKU8Rg5ckRXjDvW96oG-i106DG06vyOWIEr3MCV1cW5LJKQOQVUviemBE-qkX9VajIMBW20Zt1Sxv9RP2W_snLrz_1jrh13neruLmaVwCe8ZGeJcI4LLWtHk3KSGy9tNl9LL2uw5d8qLUR7eJRf8wlyCSdO2CQterxIi95Tox8ed95-ptSB-JyNz_7ZZrMwXt-2TAj53npLd0BwDPYNddFv-CRuHEOU7FOXEoHQuP3LEWIzuixbQXoLgn7bJ1X2qpFFve9uUYyeLvPifJrmOCKc8Uv4RH7jvpmMqvHFYwcSjop5WHI4keWDlPjp2dKRDqf5aclEsHiCbPa_17FTrwwh2qrnYT8S6F-ET63eRuQuBlWMbd16pAWPV6Gob8xKH9WIgSRHdoG0J9savLEWWiajwlY2W7a2N70JJxntosvuvv4LX49TZdcJFUz7GObIXKQqhvHgTi_j6ESHoGHbXlFJK8GqdXBsKPPim6rrQ5FAWqk437dRcYt55LhUvtWBICZP3u7jPOpPu4qHdtYq3lCej8RbgBzRtlWBtRxbrciCZknit1z_tiNHo8Luhajd0QTQ7ymJ65WhI-vMdtM7Q2m_uUG4IGK8r8qyTsgBThho7zSt-rH2huPtPLiIpFLTXvlL4fbRpusGq24WRVTTuFlRrbiCa_YXE3ivIUuqSKd5Jl2sHNbWg0_CIdA34ISwPUdMP1ViSJSdfz74CmD2G6CYTOTB1ul3giyY5wFhIpZA7OSo4STVWYeoH6xdZLNWvg4q33xjS9GqKP7jEap_x2LsTQNKVRUj6GGWjJ4-J_bo_KXGC3WmjNGaZXH8g42wRL3VzvnyGeLFnJ44Tw46XtcB6CePba4oV15aQx-uKJXhgdLOIjZRhi0g_pf9pYwPPr2PochrV888c6cug0RjyomhPC5CuyyLuupGnWjxiRBYyME_7T28ygAWTyA3923h0VujExx2aockGUf4qGjz4wzuhLbVgfnGUBzbS-NumV1UV-VJ-j1vr_oUI2abTi6YxZF18nxm_grykrFqm71GzWI7CZQC5bh0RDZLtFmQxnwl5GPq4WgG0q2cXu-8lnoUvXoDR-DqKgVnMd_-dh_pjU-MOtfKEpQEPtE5iZmlhGTGOtb_1awYUcvwRXtN2UduX0cZrHkW7lzZvz6DqJ0TX2jPd0RLBAFi8j155Tn8ohjIf-DrdO-FmSWvPf9Qbcx_9IFGEVkq5plboIIj_oRYxzNWyJ5WxR-rTgkoOeUmzFV--3qtvr7EoBVJFTX3qGe_y3nyIEdx4QjbXtzu4L8L8aJcgWaTt-0G4926GgfaneV_vYpUkiWnz9osAEr_Td6mX-BdLgu9NjiGBfIYC3we6lLsxgUjwuGkP54YnPgVgt3nLl90x6Dv2RwqPDhkCeBS6sD_ibz9_HywnYGhyFnKVJ4hLd8n4KxGirVFKAN62WBnnRF1vyEEjeRC1_NsubdIIY_DVK8UwUMbYKoA_3Hr_HZsbQitCyYlAnZtm1MFas2JouQwLgUVZZKZER8MZcQH1ldUrr91OSH853EaOcXKIqp-udBLKh6fpg_LKVKYkeCKc8dKJqU0HxDgr6q6M5KpFNnojRmTCpNZD4oHte6egjQGHKYIYPuxa91guI0CKGcwSNu2YFs8R6CZ0qz2KcxcjhKa8yQlvpyPWuN2FSM1zWhk-e1oSpCMVsmgbpM5NAWKVh0w6DvviAnp5C3SnJ6k1bTNZB6uYEFq2NzA4_te8xQADiig8VgNgcQXP6DExtKOMtGcn53LpDeMCIbKRCHmgAOraAichCrdQ4JF5lFgMyGtLpHPDl7VCW3P-ue17HfY0N_9gEvylz1jP0CCTCXUgfpg4SlY4HszcFlqEn7YI5fBhWy8wp6sJCKkFrdA_EsQSsIfnzURsGIp_xsuMN1Jf6DyQ8z1Rs6lPfYK_E0mhitiFbRldG5YtysUm7uyC3Escg4GdqHzfr_C2ta-Dc2p0dfzm2xGhyvTqc7tBuzYDoLJDbN4yIyDLENO-ib5HDo3Ffrn4q-yX9VVFMIQXDakvxaH3XOga-i7gU4naJPXjDrGIgxo2bWTOc8hrZWp7_C_ynxAkbFpADCR188HLfNN2dVk1OqRJxqRFST1OQMz7gBS52CYqkbNLnIbUDkPUqr9xRZAX2oGxFHHpwbbhhmL-YXNC0W714pGb_Kmy-rot2nMZNtjDaeC_1psWwiqHcFn5VJAehwGWaV3kqbc1oXOim73UKRtxvccmQvA5a9jAyuq7U7jOSV96L0WBq7jqBHVRr1TJTDVN44OcpQSR74F_3oN-gHk8OeLEsz72On0NRt5OTk8BW2itvmJti-zuijRaQuR0SI6Ty2T6BbPvco43iBXXM06hQSHw5BsVUrkgri9AP8FFDshXzgEHaA6DmS7A_cjjBdhySJr21E-Vcbi-OiF7ptryWzUVNy-w690Tjj53BZoaax7U61OjdzAFU7x6pr1BQdXzX0-jegG0zSkVY5HlKySbLFgNrHHNg_oR0cuVfgL_E6axnVVi4pxl4mEQgBSBK7KbRAsFbGGKUmM39WTazUCIrsISjf5u0PACBOuOwZ_NapT69aApjWlfxRULnuoiMuGx071syRNMvCBRzwr9DkoOyv5U06V969UpSJYubgOcdjrEENhNcEwaR-CcHrLDhCeSIjOr60ouFn2Ly0TnCaGAhPhrSFt1-QsmAW79Q6NnTYsgubFxIFRvxv513g7-BP9c7uUG90bOCKX5lDQov8RL26dkt0SMtjtN99axASFHLLXW4HboLJhTNzfq8QJErgs1s4C3mthb5_cJjqU-zVFwbcCk0qDjcsmgu_nFWnPw1HnVZduQldJXva-eKA66zv30YDi2tLw9XLgTzfgB6pY-F_Crv6G8BJrDIy_1Xim-rwRQAQ5YKCpZdbY_I6-csKo6gNnf5wD1h2_3CmySTenLAdmW6qh2PXzwKIs4E7Y6x04mCPVCUv5csL3CakRoiuVDIZM6-SSauh3GeyC1B2A-H7rZCjzLHMmLuMOwJdk9tc39GsTum8BuLr4gjZLkvdl4uuXIyN7XkRFdV_h_Ph9YC2_J6VYPtvD78-61Al1J-lQrZEdQIDxKzE-o6qARD1eew8YRPmTIBiexu7vZRIk8tum0j0-BHh4fz6e_OlgJ_7DD9Op3v7jBxf5"}}

Your goal is to locate the specific `unreachable` code path that causes crashes on macOS Tahoe 26.1, add instrumentation to understand why it's being hit, and potentially submit a fix.\r\n</role>\r\n\r\n<context>\r\nGhostty crashes intermittently on macOS Tahoe 26.1.0 (beta) during frame updates. The crash occurs in `renderer.generic.Renderer(renderer.Metal).updateFrame` at a consistent offset (+9560), hitting a Zig `unreachable` code path. The crash is triggered by operations that cause frame updates: window resize and text selection. Three crashes were captured, all at the identical code offset, indicating a deterministic bug rather than memory corruption. The crash happens on the renderer thread.\r\n</context>\r\n\r\n<current_state>\r\n**Done:**\r\n- Cloned ghostty-org/ghostty to ~/0xbigboss/ghostty\r\n- Analyzed 3 crash dumps from ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/\r\n- Symbolicated stack traces using atos - confirmed crash is in `updateFrame + 9560`\r\n- Identified the function is in `src/renderer/generic.zig` at line 1099\r\n- Created sanitized crash summary and GitHub discussion draft at /tmp/ghostty-discussion-draft.md\r\n\r\n**In progress:**\r\n- Need to locate the specific `unreachable` in updateFrame that's being hit\r\n- Need to understand what condition leads to hitting unreachable on Tahoe\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n- macOS Tahoe 26.1.0 (beta, build 25B78)\r\n- Ghostty 1.3.0-main+50cb1bafd (commit in repo history)\r\n- Metal renderer, CoreText font backend\r\n</current_state>\r\n\r\n<key_files>\r\n- `src/renderer/generic.zig` - Contains `updateFrame` function at line 1099. This is the crash location.\r\n- `src/renderer/Metal.zig` - Metal-specific renderer implementation\r\n- `src/renderer/metal/Frame.zig` - Frame handling for Metal\r\n- `/tmp/ghostty-discussion-draft.md` - Draft bug report for GitHub discussions\r\n- `/tmp/ghostty-crash-summary.txt` - Sanitized crash metadata\r\n- `~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/*.ghosttycrash` - Raw crash dumps (contain scrollback, sensitive)\r\n</key_files>\r\n\r\n<next_steps>\r\n1. Read `src/renderer/generic.zig` starting at line 1099 to understand the `updateFrame` function structure\r\n\r\n2. Search for all `unreachable` statements within `updateFrame` and related functions it calls - one of these is at offset +9560 from function start\r\n\r\n3. Look for switch statements or if/else branches with `unreachable` that could fail under specific conditions on macOS Tahoe (possibly related to display timing, Metal API changes, or frame synchronization)\r\n\r\n4. Build Ghostty locally in ReleaseSafe mode to reproduce:\r\n   ```\r\n   zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n5. Add logging/instrumentation around suspected unreachable paths to capture the state before crash\r\n\r\n6. If root cause is identified, create a fix and test on macOS Tahoe\r\n\r\n7. Related issue to reference: Discussion #9590 (window freeze after resize on Tahoe) - may have same root cause\r\n</next_steps>\r\n</content>\r\n</invoke>\r\n\r\n## Assistant\r\n\r\nI'll start investigating the crash by loading the Zig skill and examining the `updateFrame` function.\r\n\r\n## Assistant\r\n\r\n**Tool:** `Skill`\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"skill\": \"zig-best-practices\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Assistant\r\n\r\n**Tool:** `Read`\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"file_path\": \"/Users/allen/0xbigboss/ghostty/src/renderer/generic.zig\",\r\n  \"offset\": 1080,\r\n  \"limit\": 200\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## User\r\n\r\nBase directory for this skill: /Users/allen/.claude/skills/zig-best-practices\r\n\r\n# Zig Best Practices\r\n\r\n## Type-First Development\r\n\r\nTypes define the contract before implementation. Follow this workflow:\r\n\r\n1. **Define data structures** - structs, unions, and error sets first\r\n2. **Define function signatures** - parameters, return types, and error unions\r\n3. **Implement to satisfy types** - let the compiler guide completeness\r\n4. **Validate at comptime** - catch invalid configurations during compilation\r\n\r\n### Make Illegal States Unrepresentable\r\n\r\nUse Zig's type system to prevent invalid states at compile time.\r\n\r\n**Tagged unions for mutually exclusive states:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: only valid combinations possible\r\nconst RequestState = union(enum) {\r\n    idle,\r\n    loading,\r\n    success: []const u8,\r\n    failure: anyerror,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn handleState(state: RequestState) void {\r\n    switch (state) {\r\n        .idle => {},\r\n        .loading => showSpinner(),\r\n        .success => |data| render(data),\r\n        .failure => |err| showError(err),\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: allows invalid combinations\r\nconst RequestState = struct {\r\n    loading: bool,\r\n    data: ?[]const u8,\r\n    err: ?anyerror,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explicit error sets for failure modes:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: documents exactly what can fail\r\nconst ParseError = error{\r\n    InvalidSyntax,\r\n    UnexpectedToken,\r\n    EndOfInput,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) ParseError!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: anyerror hides failure modes\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) anyerror!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Distinct types for domain concepts:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Prevent mixing up IDs of different types\r\nconst UserId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\nconst OrderId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\n\r\nfn getUser(id: UserId) !User {\r\n    // Compiler prevents passing OrderId here\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn createUserId(raw: u64) UserId {\r\n    return @enumFromInt(raw);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Comptime validation for invariants:**\r\n```zig\r\nfn Buffer(comptime size: usize) type {\r\n    if (size == 0) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size must be greater than 0\");\r\n    }\r\n    if (size > 1024 * 1024) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size exceeds 1MB limit\");\r\n    }\r\n    return struct {\r\n        data: [size]u8 = undefined,\r\n        len: usize = 0,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Non-exhaustive enums for extensibility:**\r\n```zig\r\n// External enum that may gain variants\r\nconst Status = enum(u8) {\r\n    active = 1,\r\n    inactive = 2,\r\n    pending = 3,\r\n    _,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn processStatus(status: Status) !void {\r\n    switch (status) {\r\n"}}
