Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, tilt commands | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# Agent Development Guide\n\nA file for [guiding coding agents](https://agents.md/).\n\n## Commands\n\n- **Build:** `zig build`\n- **Test (Zig):** `zig build test`\n- **Test filter (Zig)**: `zig build test -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- **Formatting (Zig)**: `zig fmt .`\n- **Formatting (other)**: `prettier -w .`\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n- Shared Zig core: `src/`\n- C API: `include`\n- macOS app: `macos/`\n- GTK (Linux and FreeBSD) app: `src/apprt/gtk`\n\n## libghostty-vt\n\n- Build: `zig build lib-vt`\n- Build Wasm Module: `zig build lib-vt -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding`\n- Test: `zig build test-lib-vt`\n- Test filter: `zig build test-lib-vt -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- When working on libghostty-vt, do not build the full app.\n- For C only changes, don't run the Zig tests. Build all the examples.\n\n## macOS App\n\n- Do not use `xcodebuild`\n- Use `zig build` to build the macOS app and any shared Zig code\n- Use `zig build run` to build and run the macOS app\n- Run Xcode tests using `zig build test`\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"0887a23acb30e1e6bfdf33ea86c92cb6b1fbc4a1","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:ghostty-org/ghostty.git"}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Modify lldb_bt.sh\r\n- After running lldb, count frames that are just `ghostty` without function names\r\n- If >50% unsymbolicated, print warning to stderr\r\n- Still write output file regardless\r\n\r\n### 3. atos_fallback.sh\r\n```\r\nInput: minidump path, binary path, load address (from event_summary.json)\r\nProcess: extract addresses from unsymbolicated lldb output, run atos\r\nOutput: best-effort symbolicated backtrace\r\n```\r\nUses `image_addr` from event_summary.json to compute slide.\r\n\r\n### 4. Modify extract_sentry_envelope.py\r\n- Wrap main() in try/except\r\n- Map exceptions to clear messages:\r\n  - FileNotFoundError -> \"Crash file not found: {path}\"\r\n  - JSONDecodeError -> \"Invalid Sentry envelope format\"\r\n  - KeyError -> \"Missing required field: {field}\"\r\n\r\n### 5. generate_report.sh\r\n- Read event_summary.json with jq\r\n- Read lldb_bt.txt\r\n- Output REPORT.md with:\r\n  - Pre-filled: summary placeholder, context fields, evidence section, file list\r\n  - Empty: hypothesis section for manual analysis\r\n\r\n### 6. triage.sh (orchestrator)\r\n```bash\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n# Usage: triage.sh [crash_file]\r\n# If no crash_file, uses newest in ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash\r\n\r\n1. Select crash file (newest or specified)\r\n2. Create dated output dir: bug-crash-reports/YYYY-MM-DD/\r\n3. Copy crash file to output dir\r\n4. Run extract_sentry_envelope.py\r\n5. Run match_dsym.sh -> get dsym_path or warning\r\n6. Run lldb_bt.sh (with dsym if available)\r\n7. If unsymbolicated, run atos_fallback.sh\r\n8. Run generate_report.sh\r\n9. Print summary with next steps\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 7. Update SKILL.md\r\n- Add \"dSYM Archive Strategy\" section explaining:\r\n  - dSYMs are lost on rebuild\r\n  - Recommendation: copy dSYM to `~/.ghostty-dsyms/{version}/` after each release build\r\n  - Or: use Xcode archive builds which preserve dSYMs\r\n- Update workflow to reference triage.sh as primary entry point\r\n- Keep manual steps documented for advanced use\r\n\r\n## Execution Order\r\n1. match_dsym.sh (new, no dependencies)\r\n2. Modify extract_sentry_envelope.py (error handling)\r\n3. Modify lldb_bt.sh (unsymbolicated detection)\r\n4. atos_fallback.sh (new, depends on lldb_bt.sh output format)\r\n5. generate_report.sh (new, depends on extract output)\r\n6. triage.sh (orchestrator, depends on all above)\r\n7. Update SKILL.md (documentation)\r\n"}}

The crash is an index-out-of-bounds panic in `terminal.render.RenderState.linkCells`, likely due to a viewport mouse coordinate whose Y index exceeds the current render-state row count during a resize/rerender mismatch.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n- Source crash envelope: `~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/ebedc526-d37f-4134-c330-48f2b33f0763.ghosttycrash`\r\n- Extracted minidump: `7ACF95DF-31F5-4F54-8B33-8C0A304F9A92.dmp`\r\n- Release: `1.3.0-fix/kitty-overflow-logging+a2041c199`\r\n- Build mode: `ReleaseSafe`\r\n- Renderer: `metal`\r\n- Font backend: `coretext`\r\n- Thread type: `renderer`\r\n- OS: macOS 26.1.0 (build 25B78)\r\n\r\nSee `event_summary.json` for the full event metadata and debug image info.\r\n\r\n## Evidence\r\n- Backtrace: `lldb_bt.txt`\r\n- Debug IDs: `dsym_uuids.txt` (matches app debug_id `02f9811f-0f22-3c7b-bc89-79a31322db2b` to `macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM`)\r\n- Envelope + minidump saved in this directory\r\n\r\n## Symbolicated stack (excerpt)\r\nFrom `lldb_bt.txt`:\r\n- `terminal.render.RenderState.linkCells` (`render.zig:820` in that build)\r\n- `renderer.generic.Renderer.updateFrame` (`generic.zig:1192`)\r\n- `renderer.Thread.renderCallback` (`Thread.zig:607`)\r\n- `backend.kqueue.Loop.tick` / `Loop.run`\r\n\r\n## Likely cause\r\n`linkCells` indexes `row_pins[viewport_point.y]` without validating bounds. The mouse viewport point is computed from current surface size; the render-state rows are based on the terminal grid state and can lag behind during size changes, producing `y >= row_data.len` and triggering the panic.\r\n\r\n## Suggested fixes\r\n- Add a defensive bounds check in `RenderState.linkCells` to early-return when the viewport point is outside the render-state grid.\r\n- Alternatively clamp the mouse viewport point to the render-state rows/cols just before calling `linkCells` in `renderer/generic.zig`.\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n- `ebedc526-d37f-4134-c330-48f2b33f0763.ghosttycrash`\r\n- `7ACF95DF-31F5-4F54-8B33-8C0A304F9A92.dmp`\r\n- `event_summary.json`\r\n- `lldb_bt.txt`\r\n- `dsym_uuids.txt`\r\n"}}

Run `lldb_bt.sh` with the binary and (if found) dSYM search path.\n+8. Detect unsymbolicated frames from `lldb_bt.txt`:\n+   - Consider a frame unsymbolicated if the symbol is `???`, or if it matches `ghostty\\`0x[0-9a-fA-F]+`.\n+   - If ratio of unsymbolicated ghostty frames ≥ threshold, attempt atos fallback.\n+9. atos fallback (best-effort):\n+   - Extract ghostty frame addresses from `lldb_bt.txt`.\n+   - Run `atos -o <dwarf_or_binary> -arch <arch> -l <image_addr> <addr...>`.\n+   - Write `atos_bt.txt` aligned to original frames (note any missing symbols).\n+10. Generate `REPORT.md` skeleton:\n+   - Include context from `event_summary.json` (release, OS, tags).\n+   - Include evidence list and whether atos fallback ran.\n+11. Print a summary with next actions (e.g., check top frames).\n+\n+### 2) dSYM Archive Strategy (documented in SKILL.md)\n+- Recommended archive location: `~/.ghostty-dsyms/<debug_id>/Ghostty.app.dSYM`\n+- Add archive root to `dsym_search_paths` in `config.json`.\n+- When building releases, copy the `.dSYM` bundle into the archive as part of the build/release process.\n+\n+## Execution Order\n+1. Update `extract_sentry_envelope.py` error handling.\n+2. Update `lldb_bt.sh` to allow optional dSYM dir.\n+3. Add `config.json`.\n+4. Implement `triage.py` (matching + report + fallback in one place).\n+5. Update `SKILL.md` to document the new workflow and dSYM archive guidance.\n+\n+## Validation Plan\n+- Run `triage.py` on the existing sample in `bug-crash-reports/2025-12-23/` and verify:\n+  - `dsym_uuids.txt`, `lldb_bt.txt`, and `REPORT.md` are regenerated.\n+  - Symbolicated frames match prior `lldb_bt.txt` output.\n+- Force a “missing dSYM” path by temporarily moving the dSYM and confirm:\n+  - Clear warning is emitted.\n+  - atos fallback is attempted and `atos_bt.txt` is produced (even if partial).\n+\n+## Open Questions (for approval)\n+- Is Python acceptable for the orchestrator (preferred to avoid jq), or do you want a bash-only workflow?\n+- Should the dSYM archive path be `~/.ghostty-dsyms/` or a repo-local directory?\n*** End Patch"}}

Test edge cases:\n   - Empty crash directory: `python triage.py --config /dev/null` (should fail gracefully)\n   - Specific crash file: `python triage.py ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/<oldest-file>.ghosttycrash`\n   - Extra dSYM search: `python triage.py --dsym-search /nonexistent/path`\n   - Help output: `python triage.py --help`\n\n4. Verify dSYM matching logic in `find_matching_dsym()`:\n   - UUID normalization (case-insensitive, dash removal)\n   - Fat binary handling (multiple architectures)\n   - Search path ordering\n\n5. Verify unsymbolicated detection in `analyze_symbolication()`:\n   - Pattern matches both `ghostty` (no symbol) and `ghostty\\`0x...` formats\n   - Threshold calculation is correct\n\n6. Compare output against existing `bug-crash-reports/2025-12-23/` to ensure feature parity\n\n7. Check for any issues in the generated REPORT.md and atos_bt.txt formatting\n\n8. After QA, clean up test directories and provide summary of findings\n</next_steps>","images":[]}}

Select the newest crash file\r\n2. Extract the minidump and event metadata\r\n3. Search for a matching dSYM\r\n4. Symbolicate with lldb (or fall back to atos if dSYM is unavailable)\r\n5. Generate a REPORT.md skeleton\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Triage a specific crash file\r\npython scripts/triage.py ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/<id>.ghosttycrash\r\n\r\n# Specify output directory\r\npython scripts/triage.py --out-dir bug-crash-reports/my-issue\r\n\r\n# Add extra dSYM search paths\r\npython scripts/triage.py --dsym-search ~/my-dsyms\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Output Files\r\n\r\nAfter running triage, the output directory contains:\r\n\r\n| File | Description |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| `<id>.ghosttycrash` | Original crash envelope (copied) |\r\n| `<uuid>.dmp` | Extracted minidump |\r\n| `event_summary.json` | Parsed event metadata (release, OS, debug_id, etc.) |\r\n| `dsym_uuids.txt` | All discovered dSYM UUIDs for reference |\r\n| `lldb_bt.txt` | Symbolicated (or raw) backtrace from lldb |\r\n| `atos_bt.txt` | Fallback symbolication via atos (if dSYM unavailable) |\r\n| `REPORT.md` | Bug report skeleton to fill in |\r\n\r\n## dSYM Archive Strategy\r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\n\r\ndSYM files are required for symbolication but are lost when the app is rebuilt. If you rebuild Ghostty after a crash, the new dSYM won't match the crash's `debug_id`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended Solution\r\n\r\nArchive dSYMs by debug_id in `~/.ghostty-dsyms/`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/.ghostty-dsyms/\r\n├── 02F9811F-0F22-3C7B-BC89-79A31322DB2B/\r\n│   └── Ghostty.app.dSYM/\r\n├── BD9D9D6C-F0AB-318A-90A2-3192BFC87875/\r\n│   └── Ghostty.app.dSYM/\r\n└── ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter building a release, archive the dSYM:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Get the debug_id from the dSYM\r\nUUID=$(dwarfdump --uuid macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM | grep arm64 | awk '{print $2}')\r\n\r\n# Archive it\r\nmkdir -p ~/.ghostty-dsyms/$UUID\r\ncp -r macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM ~/.ghostty-dsyms/$UUID/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe triage script automatically searches `~/.ghostty-dsyms/` for matching dSYMs.\r\n\r\n### Search Order\r\n\r\nThe triage script searches these locations (in order):\r\n\r\n1. Extra paths via `--dsym-search`\r\n2. `~/.ghostty-dsyms/` (archived dSYMs)\r\n3. `macos/build/ReleaseLocal/` (local build)\r\n4. `/Applications/Ghostty.app/` (installed app)\r\n\r\nModify `scripts/config.json` to customize the search paths.\r\n\r\n## Manual Workflow\r\n\r\nFor advanced use, the individual scripts can be run manually:\r\n\r\n### 1) Extract the envelope\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython scripts/extract_sentry_envelope.py \\\r\n  ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/<id>.ghosttycrash \\\r\n  bug-crash-reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2) Match debug_id to a dSYM\r\n\r\nRead `ghostty_image.debug_id` from `event_summary.json` and compare:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndwarfdump --uuid macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3) Symbolicate with lldb\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/lldb_bt.sh \\\r\n  bug-crash-reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<minidump>.dmp \\\r\n  /Applications/Ghostty.app/Contents/MacOS/ghostty \\\r\n  macos/build/ReleaseLocal \\\r\n  bug-crash-reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>/lldb_bt.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4) Fallback with atos (if no matching dSYM)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Get load address from event_summary.json (image_addr field)\r\natos -o /path/to/ghostty -arch arm64 -l 0x100eec000 \\\r\n  0x00000001015b5d38 0x00000001015b59f8 ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Scripts\r\n\r\n| Script | Description |\r\n|--------|-------------|\r\n| `triage.py` | One-command orchestrator (recommended) |\r\n| `extract_sentry_envelope.py` | Parse `.ghosttycrash`, extract minidump |\r\n| `lldb_bt.sh` | Run lldb on a minidump, filter to frames |\r\n| `config.json` | Configuration for search paths and thresholds |\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nEdit `scripts/config.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"dsym_search_paths\": [\r\n    \"~/.ghostty-dsyms\",\r\n    \"macos/build/ReleaseLocal\",\r\n    \"/Applications/Ghostty.app/Contents/MacOS\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"crash_dir\": \"~/.local/state/ghostty/crash\",\r\n  \"output_root\": \"bug-crash-reports\",\r\n  \"unsymbolicated_threshold\": 0.5\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `dsym_search_paths`: Directories to search for dSYMs and binaries\r\n- `crash_dir`: Where Ghostty writes crash files\r\n- `output_root`: Base directory for triage output\r\n- `unsymbolicated_threshold`: Ratio of unsymbolicated frames to trigger atos fallback\r\n"}}

Must use when reading or writing Python files.\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Python Best Practices\r\n\r\n## Type-First Development\r\n\r\nTypes define the contract before implementation. Follow this workflow:\r\n\r\n1. **Define data models** - dataclasses, Pydantic models, or TypedDict first\r\n2. **Define function signatures** - parameter and return type hints\r\n3. **Implement to satisfy types** - let the type checker guide completeness\r\n4. **Validate at boundaries** - runtime checks where data enters the system\r\n\r\n### Make Illegal States Unrepresentable\r\n\r\nUse Python's type system to prevent invalid states at type-check time.\r\n\r\n**Dataclasses for structured data:**\r\n```python\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\r\nclass User:\r\n    id: str\r\n    email: str\r\n    name: str\r\n    created_at: datetime\r\n\r\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\r\nclass CreateUser:\r\n    email: str\r\n    name: str\r\n\r\n# Frozen dataclasses are immutable - no accidental mutation\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Discriminated unions with Literal:**\r\n```python\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\nfrom typing import Literal\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Idle:\r\n    status: Literal[\"idle\"] = \"idle\"\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Loading:\r\n    status: Literal[\"loading\"] = \"loading\"\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Success:\r\n    status: Literal[\"success\"] = \"success\"\r\n    data: str\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Failure:\r\n    status: Literal[\"error\"] = \"error\"\r\n    error: Exception\r\n\r\nRequestState = Idle | Loading | Success | Failure\r\n\r\ndef handle_state(state: RequestState) -> None:\r\n    match state:\r\n        case Idle():\r\n            pass\r\n        case Loading():\r\n            show_spinner()\r\n        case Success(data=data):\r\n            render(data)\r\n        case Failure(error=err):\r\n            show_error(err)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NewType for domain primitives:**\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import NewType\r\n\r\nUserId = NewType(\"UserId\", str)\r\nOrderId = NewType(\"OrderId\", str)\r\n\r\ndef get_user(user_id: UserId) -> User:\r\n    # Type checker prevents passing OrderId here\r\n    ...\r\n\r\ndef create_user_id(raw: str) -> UserId:\r\n    return UserId(raw)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Enums for constrained values:**\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum, auto\r\n\r\nclass Role(Enum):\r\n    ADMIN = auto()\r\n    USER = auto()\r\n    GUEST = auto()\r\n\r\ndef check_permission(role: Role) -> bool:\r\n    match role:\r\n        case Role.ADMIN:\r\n            return True\r\n        case Role.USER:\r\n            return limited_check()\r\n        case Role.GUEST:\r\n            return False\r\n    # Type checker warns if case is missing\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Protocol for structural typing:**\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Protocol\r\n\r\nclass Readable(Protocol):\r\n    def read(self, n: int = -1) -> bytes: ...\r\n\r\ndef process_input(source: Readable) -> bytes:\r\n    # Accepts any object with a read() method\r\n    return source.read()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TypedDict for external data shapes:**\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Required, NotRequired\r\n\r\nclass UserResponse(TypedDict):\r\n    id: Required[str]\r\n    email: Required[str]\r\n    name: Required[str]\r\n    avatar_url: NotRequired[str]\r\n\r\ndef parse_user(data: dict) -> UserResponse:\r\n    # Runtime validation needed - TypedDict is structural\r\n    return UserResponse(\r\n        id=data[\"id\"],\r\n        email=data[\"email\"],\r\n        name=data[\"name\"],\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Module Structure\r\n\r\nPrefer smaller, focused files: one class or closely related set of functions per module. Split when a file handles multiple concerns or exceeds ~300 lines. Use `__init__.py` to expose public API; keep implementation details in private modules (`_internal.py`). Colocate tests in `tests/` mirroring the source structure.\r\n\r\n## Functional Patterns\r\n\r\n- Use list/dict/set comprehensions and generator expressions over explicit loops.\r\n- Prefer `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for immutable data; avoid mutable default arguments.\r\n- Use `functools.partial` for partial application; compose small functions over large classes.\r\n- Avoid class-level mutable state; prefer pure functions that take inputs and return outputs.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n- Raise descriptive exceptions for unsupported cases; every code path returns a value or raises. This makes failures debuggable and prevents silent corruption.\r\n- Propagate exceptions with context using `from err`; catching requires re-raising or returning a meaningful result. Swallowed exceptions hide root causes.\r\n- Handle edge cases explicitly: empty inputs, `None`, boundary values. Include `else` clauses in conditionals where appropriate.\r\n- Use context managers for I/O; prefer `pathlib` and explicit encodings. Resource leaks cause production issues.\r\n- Add or adjust unit tests when touching logic; prefer minimal repros that isolate the failure.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nExplicit failure for unimplemented logic:\r\n```python\r\ndef build_widget(widget_type: str) -> Widget:\r\n    raise NotImplementedError(f\"build_widget not implemented for type: {widget_type}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nPropagate with context to preserve the original traceback:\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    data = json.loads(raw)\r\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError as err:\r\n    raise ValueError(f\"invalid JSON payload: {err}\") from err\r\n```\r\n\r\nExhaustive match with explicit default:\r\n```python\r\ndef process_status(status: str) -> str:\r\n    match status:\r\n        case \"active\":\r\n            return \"processing\"\r\n        case \"inactive\":\r\n            return \"skipped\"\r\n        case _:\r\n            raise ValueError(f\"unhandled status: {status}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nDebug-level tracing with namespaced logger:\r\n```python\r\nimport logging\r\n\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"myapp.widgets\")\r\n\r\ndef create_widget(name: str) -> Widget:\r\n    logger.debug(\"creating widget: %s\", name)\r\n    widget = Widget(name=name)\r\n    logger.debug(\"created widget id=%s\", widget.id)\r\n"}}
