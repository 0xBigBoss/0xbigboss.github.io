Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, `tilt` CLI, tilt process management | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Process management\n\nLoad the `tilt` skill before running tilt CLI commands or managing tilt processes.\n\nMultiple Claude Code sessions may run concurrently across different repos. Never use broad process kills that affect other sessions.\n\n**Forbidden:**\n- `pkill tilt`, `killall tilt`, `pkill node`, etc.\n- Any kill command without filtering by working directory or PID\n\n**Required approach:**\n1. Identify processes spawned from the current repo (check cwd, parent process, or port)\n2. Kill only the specific PID(s) belonging to this session\n3. If unable to isolate the target process, treat as **blocked** and ask the user\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\n# Good: kill by specific PID after identifying it\nlsof -i :10350 | grep LISTEN  # find process on your port\nkill <specific-pid>\n\n# Good: filter by working directory\npgrep -f \"tilt.*$(pwd)\"\n\n# Bad: kills all tilt processes across all sessions\npkill tilt\n```\n\nWhen restarting services (tilt, docker-compose, dev servers), always verify you're targeting only processes from your working directory.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"exec","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"e391aed45d903e78f3fca5eca3cbc78ba53a8788","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:0xBigBoss/0xbigboss.github.io.git"}}}

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

And yet, they drove an AI with expert skill.\"\r\n- \"I want to call out that in addition to driving AI with expert skill, they **navigated the terrain with expert skill as well**. They didn't just toss slop up on our repo. They came to Discord as a human, reached out as a human, and talked to other humans about what they've done. They were careful and thoughtful about the process.\"\r\n- \"People like this give me hope for what is possible.\"\r\n\r\nSource: https://x.com/mitchellh/status/2006114026191769924\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The 4 Crash Reports (GitHub Discussions)\r\n\r\nAll filed as Issue Triage, all Closed & Answered:\r\n\r\n1. **Search thread crash: integer underflow in CircBuf.getPtrSlice**\r\n   - https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/10063\r\n   - 1 upvote, 2 comments (Dec 26, 2025)\r\n\r\n2. **Renderer crash: viewport pin overflow in getBottomRight after resize**\r\n   - https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/10074\r\n   - 3 upvotes, 2 comments (Dec 26, 2025)\r\n\r\n3. **Crash: OSC8 hyperlink hover during resize causes index-out-of-bounds panic in linkCells**\r\n   - https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/10032\r\n   - 1 upvote, 1 comment (Dec 23, 2025)\r\n\r\n4. **linkCells assertion failure with large scrollback when hovering hyperlinks**\r\n   - https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/9957\r\n   - 1 upvote, 1 comment (Dec 18, 2025 - the first one filed)\r\n\r\nSource: https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aclosed+crash+author%3A0xBigBoss\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Process / Story Arc\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n- No experience with: Zig, macOS development, terminal emulators\r\n- Was experiencing crashes while using Ghostty\r\n- Decided to investigate using AI tools (Claude Code, Codex)\r\n\r\n### What I Built\r\n- Python script to decode crash files\r\n- Matched crash files with dsym files\r\n- Analyzed codebase to find root causes\r\n- Extracted the workflow into a reusable Agent Skill\r\n\r\n### The Approach\r\n- Used AI as a driver/collaborator, not just a code generator\r\n- Thought critically about the AI's analysis\r\n- Verified the issues seemed real before reporting\r\n- Reached out on Discord first to ask if reports would be welcome\r\n- Was transparent about using AI and lack of domain expertise\r\n\r\n### Key Lessons\r\n- \"Driving AI with expert skill\" - what does this mean?\r\n- Navigating the human/social terrain is just as important\r\n- Being transparent about AI usage and limitations\r\n- Asking permission before dumping issues\r\n- Quality over quantity\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Session Transcripts\r\n\r\n98 Claude Code/Codex sessions saved to:\r\n`/Users/allen/0xbigboss/0xbigboss.github.io/drafts/ghostty-transcripts/`\r\n\r\nTotal size: 30MB\r\n\r\nLargest sessions (likely the most substantive work):\r\n- `2967cad7-8cec-4ea2-8537-1ba88d6f40e3.jsonl` - 13MB (Dec 26)\r\n- `8caea3d6-0afc-413f-bc44-14844fd6f44f.jsonl` - 3.2MB (Dec 18)\r\n- `87bb4fdf-8200-40f9-bbfa-60be10dd5a81.jsonl` - 1.7MB (Dec 19)\r\n- `9f8a0219-dcb2-4a62-82c4-4829c95a6b79.jsonl` - 1.6MB (Dec 18)\r\n- `3d2f7fc3-95f9-4197-b304-b0506281f487.jsonl` - 1.5MB (Dec 26)\r\n\r\nSessions span: Dec 17, 2025 - Jan 1, 2026\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Potential Blog Structure\r\n\r\n1. **Hook**: Mitchell's tweet and the recognition\r\n2. **The Problem**: Experiencing crashes, no domain expertise\r\n3. **The Approach**: How I used AI tools to investigate\r\n4. **The Technical Work**: Building the crash analysis workflow\r\n5. **The Human Element**: Discord, asking permission, being transparent\r\n6. **The Results**: 4 real bugs fixed\r\n7. **Lessons Learned**: What \"driving AI with expert skill\" really means\r\n8. **Conclusion**: The future of AI-assisted contribution\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Deliverable Status\r\n\r\nThis task was to **gather research and notes** for a future blog post. All research deliverables are complete:\r\n\r\n| Deliverable | Status | Location |\r\n|-------------|--------|----------|\r\n| Mitchell's X post quotes | Complete | This file (above) |\r\n| GitHub discussion URLs | Complete | This file (above) |\r\n| Session transcript excerpts | Complete | [analysis doc](./ghostty-contribution-analysis.md) |\r\n| Crash triage skill source | Complete | `drafts/ghostty-crash-triage-skill/` |\r\n| Raw session transcripts | Complete | `drafts/ghostty-transcripts/` (98 files) |\r\n| Session summaries | Complete | `drafts/ghostty-session-summaries.md` (98 sessions) |\r\n| AI strategy analysis | Complete | [analysis doc](./ghostty-contribution-analysis.md) |\r\n\r\n**Note:** Writing the actual blog post is a separate future task that will use these materials as input.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- The term \"slop\" refers to low-quality AI-generated content dumped without thought\r\n- Mitchell emphasizes the *human* skills as much as the AI driving skills\r\n- The ask-first approach was critical to acceptance\r\n"}}

Read src/renderer/generic.zig starting at line 1099\r\n2. Search for all `unreachable` statements\r\n3. Look for switch/if branches that could fail on Tahoe\r\n</next_steps>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why This Works\r\n\r\n| Element | Purpose |\r\n|---------|---------|\r\n| `<role>` | Frames AI's identity and goal |\r\n| `<context>` | Provides technical background |\r\n| `<current_state>` | Prevents redundant work |\r\n| `<key_files>` | Points AI to relevant code |\r\n| `<next_steps>` | Provides action sequence |\r\n\r\n### Session Handoffs\r\n\r\nCreated `/handoff` command to generate context-preserving prompts for new sessions:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<role>\r\nYou are a debugger continuing investigation of a Ghostty Metal\r\nrenderer crash on macOS Tahoe 26.1.0. Focus on the viewport row\r\niteration null unwrap and verify the new instrumentation logs.\r\n</role>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key insight:** AI sessions are stateless. Explicit handoffs bridge context across conversations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 2: Investigation Workflow\r\n\r\n### The Iteration Loop\r\n\r\n```\r\nhypothesis → instrumentation → build → test → analyze → refine\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example cycle:**\r\n1. Identify candidate `unreachable` statements\r\n2. Add logging instrumentation to each\r\n3. Build with `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe`\r\n4. Run and trigger crash\r\n5. Analyze logs to narrow down\r\n6. Repeat with refined hypothesis\r\n\r\n### Multi-Layer Verification\r\n\r\n1. **Syntax check:** AI runs `zig ast-check` before claiming changes valid\r\n2. **Build verification:** Compile to catch errors\r\n3. **Startup marker:** Look for \"LOCAL BUILD\" in logs\r\n4. **Log stream:** `sudo log stream --predicate 'subsystem==\"com.mitchellh.ghostty\"' | grep \"LOCAL BUILD|BUG:\"`\r\n\r\n### Critical Lesson: Wrong Binary\r\n\r\nThe AI caught a major mistake:\r\n\r\n> \"That crash was from the **old Ghostty** (version 1.3.0-main+e515d0847), not your local build. There's no 'LOCAL BUILD' marker in the logs.\"\r\n\r\nThe startup marker pattern proved essential for distinguishing builds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 3: Domain Translation\r\n\r\n### Treating AI as Subject Matter Expert\r\n\r\nInstead of learning Zig/Metal/terminals, asked questions at the right abstraction level:\r\n\r\n- \"Is there a way to build only the version I need for Mac?\"\r\n- \"Will this build get us closer to the root cause?\"\r\n- \"I'm already running one version of Ghostty - will they interfere?\"\r\n\r\n### Building Mental Models Through AI\r\n\r\nAsked for explanations to understand the codebase:\r\n\r\n> \"Look at the recent linkCells fix in the git log. Trace through the ghostty code and explain high level the architecture and why the OOB crash is even possible.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 4: Tools Built\r\n\r\n> **Note:** These tools were created during the investigation. A copy is included in this repo at `drafts/ghostty-crash-triage-skill/` for reference.\r\n\r\n### ghostty-crash-triage Skill\r\n\r\nOne-command orchestrator for crash analysis. Full source included at `drafts/ghostty-crash-triage-skill/`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndrafts/ghostty-crash-triage-skill/\r\n├── SKILL.md                         # Usage documentation (6.8KB)\r\n├── scripts/\r\n│   ├── triage.py                    # Main orchestrator (22KB)\r\n│   ├── extract_sentry_envelope.py   # Sentry envelope parser (5.2KB)\r\n│   ├── lldb_bt.sh                   # Symbolication wrapper (1.5KB)\r\n│   └── config.json                  # Configuration\r\n├── assets/                          # (empty - for screenshots)\r\n└── references/                      # (empty - for docs)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What it does:**\r\n1. Auto-selects newest crash file from `~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/`\r\n2. Extracts minidump and event metadata\r\n3. Searches for matching dSYM by debug_id\r\n4. Symbolicates with lldb (fallback to atos)\r\n5. Generates `REPORT.md` skeleton\r\n\r\n### dSYM Archiving Strategy\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Archive by debug_id for future symbolication\r\nUUID=$(dwarfdump --uuid Ghostty.app.dSYM | grep arm64 | awk '{print $2}')\r\nmkdir -p ~/.ghostty-dsyms/$UUID\r\ncp -r Ghostty.app.dSYM ~/.ghostty-dsyms/$UUID/\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 5: The Four Crashes Fixed\r\n\r\n### 1. Viewport Overflow Panic (`getBottomRight`)\r\n- **File:** `src/terminal/PageList.zig:3980`\r\n- **Root cause:** After resize, viewport pin positioned past valid bounds\r\n- **Arithmetic:** `rows=76, total_rows=116, pin.y=46` → `46+75=121 > 115`\r\n\r\n### 2. Integer Underflow in CircBuf (`getPtrSlice`)\r\n- **File:** `src/datastruct/CircBuf.zig`\r\n- **Root cause:** Zero-length slice requests caused underflow\r\n\r\n### 3. linkCells Out-of-Bounds\r\n- **File:** `src/terminal/render.zig`\r\n- **Root cause:** Viewport-relative y coords passed where page-relative expected\r\n\r\n### 4. Virtual Placement Pin Outside Viewport\r\n- **File:** `src/renderer/generic.zig:1835`\r\n- **Root cause:** Viewport bounds captured but changed before use\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 6: Key Quotes for Blog\r\n\r\n### On Hypothesis Formation\r\n> \"**Hypothesis**: During window resize on macOS Tahoe, there's a timing issue where... the pin is no longer within the viewport bounds by the time `pointFromPin(.viewport, pin)` is called.\"\r\n\r\n### On User Agency\r\n> \"Will this build get us closer to the root cause? Let's try with symbols enabled. I am willing to pay the performance cost.\"\r\n\r\n### On Instrumentation Strategy\r\n> \"Instrument all potential crash sites rather than betting on a single hypothesis.\"\r\n\r\n### On Progress Without Resolution\r\n> \"When the crash happens, you'll get exact file:line info... This will definitively tell us which unreachable is being hit.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 7: Patterns Summary\r\n\r\n| Pattern | Implementation |\r\n|---------|----------------|\r\n| **Explicit role framing** | XML tags with role, context, state |\r\n| **State preservation** | `/handoff` prompts with Done/In-progress |\r\n| **Hypothesis-driven iteration** | Instrument → build → test → analyze |\r\n| **Domain abstraction** | Ask \"how do I run it\" vs. reading docs |\r\n| **Multi-layer verification** | Syntax → build → marker → log stream |\r\n| **Atomic task decomposition** | Numbered steps in prompts |\r\n| **Subagent delegation** | Parallel investigations |\r\n| **Reusable skills** | `ghostty-crash-triage` command |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Meta-Insight\r\n\r\n\"Driving AI with expert skill\" is less about domain expertise and more about:\r\n"}}

Use when debugging Ghostty renderer crashes, OSC8 hover issues, or any panic/index-out-of-bounds reports captured in ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash.\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Ghostty Crash Triage\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nExtract a Sentry envelope from `~/.local/state/ghostty/crash`, match its debug ID to a dSYM, symbolicate the minidump, and write a minimal bug report with evidence in the repo archive.\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nRun the one-command triage (from the ghostty repo where this skill was originally used):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Original location in ghostty repo:\r\npython .claude/skills/ghostty-crash-triage/scripts/triage.py\r\n\r\n# Or if using this archived copy:\r\npython drafts/ghostty-crash-triage-skill/scripts/triage.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will:\r\n1. Select the newest crash file\r\n2. Extract the minidump and event metadata\r\n3. Search for a matching dSYM\r\n4. Symbolicate with lldb (or fall back to atos if dSYM is unavailable)\r\n5. Generate a REPORT.md skeleton\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Triage a specific crash file\r\npython scripts/triage.py ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/<id>.ghosttycrash\r\n\r\n# Specify output directory\r\npython scripts/triage.py --out-dir bug-crash-reports/my-issue\r\n\r\n# Add extra dSYM search paths\r\npython scripts/triage.py --dsym-search ~/my-dsyms\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Output Files\r\n\r\nAfter running triage, the output directory contains:\r\n\r\n| File | Description |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| `<id>.ghosttycrash` | Original crash envelope (copied) |\r\n| `<uuid>.dmp` | Extracted minidump |\r\n| `event_summary.json` | Parsed event metadata (release, OS, debug_id, etc.) |\r\n| `dsym_uuids.txt` | All discovered dSYM UUIDs for reference |\r\n| `lldb_bt.txt` | Symbolicated (or raw) backtrace from lldb |\r\n| `atos_bt.txt` | Fallback symbolication via atos (if dSYM unavailable) |\r\n| `REPORT.md` | Bug report skeleton to fill in |\r\n\r\n## dSYM Archive Strategy\r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\n\r\ndSYM files are required for symbolication but are lost when the app is rebuilt. If you rebuild Ghostty after a crash, the new dSYM won't match the crash's `debug_id`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended Solution\r\n\r\nArchive dSYMs by debug_id in `~/.ghostty-dsyms/`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/.ghostty-dsyms/\r\n├── 02F9811F-0F22-3C7B-BC89-79A31322DB2B/\r\n│   └── Ghostty.app.dSYM/\r\n├── BD9D9D6C-F0AB-318A-90A2-3192BFC87875/\r\n│   └── Ghostty.app.dSYM/\r\n└── ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter building a release, archive the dSYM:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Get the debug_id from the dSYM\r\nUUID=$(dwarfdump --uuid macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM | grep arm64 | awk '{print $2}')\r\n\r\n# Archive it\r\nmkdir -p ~/.ghostty-dsyms/$UUID\r\ncp -r macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM ~/.ghostty-dsyms/$UUID/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe triage script automatically searches `~/.ghostty-dsyms/` for matching dSYMs.\r\n\r\n### Search Order\r\n\r\nThe triage script searches these locations (in order):\r\n\r\n1. Extra paths via `--dsym-search`\r\n2. `~/.ghostty-dsyms/` (archived dSYMs)\r\n3. `macos/build/ReleaseLocal/` (local build)\r\n4. `/Applications/Ghostty.app/` (installed app)\r\n\r\nModify `scripts/config.json` to customize the search paths.\r\n\r\n## Manual Workflow\r\n\r\nFor advanced use, the individual scripts can be run manually:\r\n\r\n### 1) Extract the envelope\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython scripts/extract_sentry_envelope.py \\\r\n  ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/<id>.ghosttycrash \\\r\n  bug-crash-reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2) Match debug_id to a dSYM\r\n\r\nRead `ghostty_image.debug_id` from `event_summary.json` and compare:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndwarfdump --uuid macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3) Symbolicate with lldb\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/lldb_bt.sh \\\r\n  bug-crash-reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<minidump>.dmp \\\r\n  /Applications/Ghostty.app/Contents/MacOS/ghostty \\\r\n  macos/build/ReleaseLocal \\\r\n  bug-crash-reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>/lldb_bt.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4) Fallback with atos (if no matching dSYM)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Get load address from event_summary.json (image_addr field)\r\natos -o /path/to/ghostty -arch arm64 -l 0x100eec000 \\\r\n  0x00000001015b5d38 0x00000001015b59f8 ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Scripts\r\n\r\n| Script | Description |\r\n|--------|-------------|\r\n| `triage.py` | One-command orchestrator (recommended) |\r\n| `extract_sentry_envelope.py` | Parse `.ghosttycrash`, extract minidump |\r\n| `lldb_bt.sh` | Run lldb on a minidump, filter to frames |\r\n| `config.json` | Configuration for search paths and thresholds |\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nEdit `scripts/config.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"dsym_search_paths\": [\r\n    \"~/.ghostty-dsyms\",\r\n    \"macos/build/ReleaseLocal\",\r\n    \"/Applications/Ghostty.app/Contents/MacOS\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"crash_dir\": \"~/.local/state/ghostty/crash\",\r\n  \"output_root\": \"bug-crash-reports\",\r\n  \"unsymbolicated_threshold\": 0.5\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `dsym_search_paths`: Directories to search for dSYMs and binaries\r\n- `crash_dir`: Where Ghostty writes crash files\r\n- `output_root`: Base directory for triage output\r\n- `unsymbolicated_threshold`: Ratio of unsymbolicated frames to trigger atos fallback\r\n\r\n## Creating GitHub Discussions\r\n\r\nGhostty uses GitHub Discussions as the first line of reporting for bugs and crashes. The triage script generates a `REPORT.md` skeleton in the output directory with crash details. You can then adapt this into a GitHub Discussion.\r\n\r\n### Report Template\r\n\r\nThe generated `REPORT.md` includes:\r\n\r\n| Section | Description |\r\n|---------|-------------|\r\n| Issue Description | Detailed description with root cause, trigger, Sentry UUID, and symbolicated stack trace |\r\n| Expected Behavior | What should happen (e.g., \"empty slice should be a no-op\") |\r\n| Actual Behavior | What actually happens (the crash) |\r\n| Reproduction Steps | Steps to trigger the crash |\r\n| Ghostty Logs | The panic message and relevant stack frames |\r\n| Ghostty Version | Output from `event_summary.json` or `ghostty +version` |\r\n| OS Version | From `event_summary.json` contexts.os |\r\n| Minimal Config | Configuration needed to reproduce (or \"default\") |\r\n| Fix (if available) | Commit hash and summary of the fix |\r\n\r\nThe output directory (e.g., `bug-crash-reports/2025-12-25/`) will contain the generated `REPORT.md`.\r\n\r\n### Creating via GitHub CLI\r\n\r\nAfter editing `REPORT.md` with your analysis, create the discussion using the GraphQL API:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Read the report content\r\nBODY=$(cat bug-crash-reports/<date>/REPORT.md)\r\nTITLE=\"Search thread crash: integer underflow in CircBuf.getPtrSlice\"\r\n\r\n# Create the discussion\r\ngh api graphql -f query='\r\nmutation($repositoryId: ID!, $categoryId: ID!, $title: String!, $body: String!) {\r\n  createDiscussion(input: {\r\n    repositoryId: $repositoryId\r\n    categoryId: $categoryId\r\n    title: $title\r\n    body: $body\r\n  }) {\r\n    discussion {\r\n      url\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}' \\\r\n  -f repositoryId=\"R_kgDOHFhdAg\" \\\r\n  -f categoryId=\"DIC_kwDOHFhdAs4Cmv-L\" \\\r\n  -f title=\"$TITLE\" \\\r\n  -f body=\"$BODY\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reference IDs\r\n\r\n| ID | Description |\r\n|----|-------------|\r\n| `R_kgDOHFhdAg` | ghostty-org/ghostty repository ID |\r\n| `DIC_kwDOHFhdAs4Cmv-L` | Issue Triage category ID |\r\n\r\n### Listing Categories\r\n\r\nTo discover category IDs:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngh api graphql -f query='{\r\n  repository(owner: \"ghostty-org\", name: \"ghostty\") {\r\n    discussionCategories(first: 10) {\r\n      nodes { id name }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n"}}
