Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, `tilt` CLI, tilt process management | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Process management\n\nLoad the `tilt` skill before running tilt CLI commands or managing tilt processes.\n\nMultiple Claude Code sessions may run concurrently across different repos. Never use broad process kills that affect other sessions.\n\n**Forbidden:**\n- `pkill tilt`, `killall tilt`, `pkill node`, etc.\n- Any kill command without filtering by working directory or PID\n\n**Required approach:**\n1. Identify processes spawned from the current repo (check cwd, parent process, or port)\n2. Kill only the specific PID(s) belonging to this session\n3. If unable to isolate the target process, treat as **blocked** and ask the user\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\n# Good: kill by specific PID after identifying it\nlsof -i :10350 | grep LISTEN  # find process on your port\nkill <specific-pid>\n\n# Good: filter by working directory\npgrep -f \"tilt.*$(pwd)\"\n\n# Bad: kills all tilt processes across all sessions\npkill tilt\n```\n\nWhen restarting services (tilt, docker-compose, dev servers), always verify you're targeting only processes from your working directory.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"exec","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"e391aed45d903e78f3fca5eca3cbc78ba53a8788","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:0xBigBoss/0xbigboss.github.io.git"}}}

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Read src/renderer/generic.zig starting at line 1099\r\n2. Search for all `unreachable` statements\r\n3. Look for switch/if branches that could fail on Tahoe\r\n</next_steps>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why This Works\r\n\r\n| Element | Purpose |\r\n|---------|---------|\r\n| `<role>` | Frames AI's identity and goal |\r\n| `<context>` | Provides technical background |\r\n| `<current_state>` | Prevents redundant work |\r\n| `<key_files>` | Points AI to relevant code |\r\n| `<next_steps>` | Provides action sequence |\r\n\r\n### Session Handoffs\r\n\r\nCreated `/handoff` command to generate context-preserving prompts for new sessions:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<role>\r\nYou are a debugger continuing investigation of a Ghostty Metal\r\nrenderer crash on macOS Tahoe 26.1.0. Focus on the viewport row\r\niteration null unwrap and verify the new instrumentation logs.\r\n</role>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key insight:** AI sessions are stateless. Explicit handoffs bridge context across conversations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 2: Investigation Workflow\r\n\r\n### The Iteration Loop\r\n\r\n```\r\nhypothesis → instrumentation → build → test → analyze → refine\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example cycle:**\r\n1. Identify candidate `unreachable` statements\r\n2. Add logging instrumentation to each\r\n3. Build with `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe`\r\n4. Run and trigger crash\r\n5. Analyze logs to narrow down\r\n6. Repeat with refined hypothesis\r\n\r\n### Multi-Layer Verification\r\n\r\n1. **Syntax check:** AI runs `zig ast-check` before claiming changes valid\r\n2. **Build verification:** Compile to catch errors\r\n3. **Startup marker:** Look for \"LOCAL BUILD\" in logs\r\n4. **Log stream:** `sudo log stream --predicate 'subsystem==\"com.mitchellh.ghostty\"' | grep \"LOCAL BUILD|BUG:\"`\r\n\r\n### Critical Lesson: Wrong Binary\r\n\r\nThe AI caught a major mistake:\r\n\r\n> \"That crash was from the **old Ghostty** (version 1.3.0-main+e515d0847), not your local build. There's no 'LOCAL BUILD' marker in the logs.\"\r\n\r\nThe startup marker pattern proved essential for distinguishing builds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 3: Domain Translation\r\n\r\n### Treating AI as Subject Matter Expert\r\n\r\nInstead of learning Zig/Metal/terminals, asked questions at the right abstraction level:\r\n\r\n- \"Is there a way to build only the version I need for Mac?\"\r\n- \"Will this build get us closer to the root cause?\"\r\n- \"I'm already running one version of Ghostty - will they interfere?\"\r\n\r\n### Building Mental Models Through AI\r\n\r\nAsked for explanations to understand the codebase:\r\n\r\n> \"Look at the recent linkCells fix in the git log. Trace through the ghostty code and explain high level the architecture and why the OOB crash is even possible.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 4: Tools Built\r\n\r\n### ghostty-crash-triage Skill\r\n\r\nOne-command orchestrator for crash analysis:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.claude/skills/ghostty-crash-triage/\r\n├── SKILL.md\r\n├── scripts/\r\n│   ├── triage.py              # Main orchestrator\r\n│   ├── extract_sentry_envelope.py\r\n│   └── lldb_bt.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What it does:**\r\n1. Auto-selects newest crash file from `~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/`\r\n2. Extracts minidump and event metadata\r\n3. Searches for matching dSYM by debug_id\r\n4. Symbolicates with lldb (fallback to atos)\r\n5. Generates `REPORT.md` skeleton\r\n\r\n### dSYM Archiving Strategy\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Archive by debug_id for future symbolication\r\nUUID=$(dwarfdump --uuid Ghostty.app.dSYM | grep arm64 | awk '{print $2}')\r\nmkdir -p ~/.ghostty-dsyms/$UUID\r\ncp -r Ghostty.app.dSYM ~/.ghostty-dsyms/$UUID/\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 5: The Four Crashes Fixed\r\n\r\n### 1. Viewport Overflow Panic (`getBottomRight`)\r\n- **File:** `src/terminal/PageList.zig:3980`\r\n- **Root cause:** After resize, viewport pin positioned past valid bounds\r\n- **Arithmetic:** `rows=76, total_rows=116, pin.y=46` → `46+75=121 > 115`\r\n\r\n### 2. Integer Underflow in CircBuf (`getPtrSlice`)\r\n- **File:** `src/datastruct/CircBuf.zig`\r\n- **Root cause:** Zero-length slice requests caused underflow\r\n\r\n### 3. linkCells Out-of-Bounds\r\n- **File:** `src/terminal/render.zig`\r\n- **Root cause:** Viewport-relative y coords passed where page-relative expected\r\n\r\n### 4. Virtual Placement Pin Outside Viewport\r\n- **File:** `src/renderer/generic.zig:1835`\r\n- **Root cause:** Viewport bounds captured but changed before use\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 6: Key Quotes for Blog\r\n\r\n### On Hypothesis Formation\r\n> \"**Hypothesis**: During window resize on macOS Tahoe, there's a timing issue where... the pin is no longer within the viewport bounds by the time `pointFromPin(.viewport, pin)` is called.\"\r\n\r\n### On User Agency\r\n> \"Will this build get us closer to the root cause? Let's try with symbols enabled. I am willing to pay the performance cost.\"\r\n\r\n### On Instrumentation Strategy\r\n> \"Instrument all potential crash sites rather than betting on a single hypothesis.\"\r\n\r\n### On Progress Without Resolution\r\n> \"When the crash happens, you'll get exact file:line info... This will definitively tell us which unreachable is being hit.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part 7: Patterns Summary\r\n\r\n| Pattern | Implementation |\r\n"}}

Your goal is to build the instrumented code, reproduce the crash, capture the diagnostic log output, and identify the root cause of the `unreachable` being hit.\\n</role>\\n\\n<context>\\nGhostty crashes intermittently on macOS Tahoe 26.1.0 (beta) during window resize, display changes, and text selection. The crash occurs in `renderer.generic.Renderer(renderer.Metal).updateFrame` hitting a Zig `unreachable` code path. Multiple crashes have been captured at identical offsets (+9560), indicating a deterministic bug. Investigation identified the most likely culprit as line 1835 in `prepKittyVirtualPlacement`, where the assumption that \\\"virtual placements are always within the viewport\\\" may be violated during resize/display operations.\\n</context>\\n\\n<current_state>\\n**Done:**\\n- Analyzed crash dumps confirming crash at `updateFrame + 9560`\\n- Identified 5 `unreachable` statements in the updateFrame call path\\n- Added instrumentation logging before the most likely unreachable (line 1835 in `prepKittyVirtualPlacement`)\\n- Added startup log message \\\"LOCAL BUILD: unreachable instrumentation enabled\\\" to identify local builds\\n- Existing commit on branch adds overflow logging for kitty placement y coordinates (different code path)\\n\\n**In progress:**\\n- Need to build and run the instrumented code\\n- Need to reproduce the crash and capture the log output\\n\\n**Recent crash (uninstrumented build):**\\n```\\nSEL: delthread 8865262 panic: reached unreachable code\\n???:?:?: 0x100d4e47b in ???

(ghostty)\\n```\\nThis crash occurred with the old build (no instrumentation), so no diagnostic info was captured.\\n\\n**Hypothesis:**\\nDuring resize/display changes, `placementIterator(top, bot)` captures viewport boundaries, but by the time `pointFromPin(.viewport, pin)` is called, the pin may be outside current viewport bounds due to timing/synchronization issues specific to macOS Tahoe.\\n</current_state>\\n\\n<key_files>\\n- `src/renderer/generic.zig` - Contains the instrumented unreachable at line 1835 in `prepKittyVirtualPlacement`. Also contains `updateFrame` (line 1099), `prepKittyGraphics` (line 1680), and `rebuildCells` (line 2367).\\n- `src/global.zig` - Contains startup log message to identify local builds (line 130).\\n- `src/terminal/kitty/graphics_unicode.zig` - Contains `placementIterator` that iterates viewport placements.\\n- `src/terminal/PageList.zig` - Contains `pointFromPin` that converts pins to viewport coordinates.\\n</key_files>\\n\\n<next_steps>\\n1. Build the instrumented code:\\n   ```bash\\n   zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe -Demit-xcframework=false\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Kill any existing Ghostty and run the local build:\\n   ```bash\\n   pkill -9 ghostty\\n   zig-out/Ghostty.app/Contents/MacOS/ghostty\\n   ```\\n\\n3. In a separate Terminal.app window, watch for logs:\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo log stream --level debug --predicate 'subsystem==\\\"com.mitchellh.ghostty\\\"' | grep -E \\\"LOCAL BUILD|BUG:|overflow\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n4. Trigger the crash by:\\n   - Resizing windows\\n   - Moving windows between displays\\n   - Selecting text during resize operations\\n\\n5. When crash occurs, check if the log shows:\\n   - `LOCAL BUILD: unreachable instrumentation enabled` (confirms correct build)\\n   - `BUG: virtual placement pin outside viewport` with image_id, placement_id, pin coordinates\\n\\n6. If the BUG log appears, investigate why `pointFromPin` returns null:\\n   - Check `placementIterator` bounds vs `pointFromPin` viewport calculation\\n   - Look for race conditions in viewport state during resize\\n\\n7. If crash occurs WITHOUT the BUG log, the crash is at a different unreachable - add instrumentation to remaining candidates in `rebuildCells` (lines 2973, 3043, 3097, 3291).\\n\\n8.

Your goal is to locate the specific `unreachable` code path that causes crashes on macOS Tahoe 26.1, add instrumentation to understand why it's being hit, and potentially submit a fix.\r\n</role>\r\n\r\n<context>\r\nGhostty crashes intermittently on macOS Tahoe 26.1.0 (beta) during frame updates. The crash occurs in `renderer.generic.Renderer(renderer.Metal).updateFrame` at a consistent offset (+9560), hitting a Zig `unreachable` code path. The crash is triggered by operations that cause frame updates: window resize and text selection. Three crashes were captured, all at the identical code offset, indicating a deterministic bug rather than memory corruption. The crash happens on the renderer thread.\r\n</context>\r\n\r\n<current_state>\r\n**Done:**\r\n- Cloned ghostty-org/ghostty to ~/0xbigboss/ghostty\r\n- Analyzed 3 crash dumps from ~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/\r\n- Symbolicated stack traces using atos - confirmed crash is in `updateFrame + 9560`\r\n- Identified the function is in `src/renderer/generic.zig` at line 1099\r\n- Created sanitized crash summary and GitHub discussion draft at /tmp/ghostty-discussion-draft.md\r\n\r\n**In progress:**\r\n- Need to locate the specific `unreachable` in updateFrame that's being hit\r\n- Need to understand what condition leads to hitting unreachable on Tahoe\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n- macOS Tahoe 26.1.0 (beta, build 25B78)\r\n- Ghostty 1.3.0-main+50cb1bafd (commit in repo history)\r\n- Metal renderer, CoreText font backend\r\n</current_state>\r\n\r\n<key_files>\r\n- `src/renderer/generic.zig` - Contains `updateFrame` function at line 1099. This is the crash location.\r\n- `src/renderer/Metal.zig` - Metal-specific renderer implementation\r\n- `src/renderer/metal/Frame.zig` - Frame handling for Metal\r\n- `/tmp/ghostty-discussion-draft.md` - Draft bug report for GitHub discussions\r\n- `/tmp/ghostty-crash-summary.txt` - Sanitized crash metadata\r\n- `~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/*.ghosttycrash` - Raw crash dumps (contain scrollback, sensitive)\r\n</key_files>\r\n\r\n<next_steps>\r\n1. Read `src/renderer/generic.zig` starting at line 1099 to understand the `updateFrame` function structure\r\n\r\n2. Search for all `unreachable` statements within `updateFrame` and related functions it calls - one of these is at offset +9560 from function start\r\n\r\n3. Look for switch statements or if/else branches with `unreachable` that could fail under specific conditions on macOS Tahoe (possibly related to display timing, Metal API changes, or frame synchronization)\r\n\r\n4. Build Ghostty locally in ReleaseSafe mode to reproduce:\r\n   ```\r\n   zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n5. Add logging/instrumentation around suspected unreachable paths to capture the state before crash\r\n\r\n6. If root cause is identified, create a fix and test on macOS Tahoe\r\n\r\n7. Related issue to reference: Discussion #9590 (window freeze after resize on Tahoe) - may have same root cause\r\n</next_steps>\r\n</content>\r\n</invoke>\r\n\r\n## Assistant\r\n\r\nI'll start investigating the crash by loading the Zig skill and examining the `updateFrame` function.\r\n\r\n## Assistant\r\n\r\n**Tool:** `Skill`\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"skill\": \"zig-best-practices\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Assistant\r\n\r\n**Tool:** `Read`\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"file_path\": \"/Users/allen/0xbigboss/ghostty/src/renderer/generic.zig\",\r\n  \"offset\": 1080,\r\n  \"limit\": 200\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## User\r\n\r\nBase directory for this skill: /Users/allen/.claude/skills/zig-best-practices\r\n\r\n# Zig Best Practices\r\n\r\n## Type-First Development\r\n\r\nTypes define the contract before implementation. Follow this workflow:\r\n\r\n1. **Define data structures** - structs, unions, and error sets first\r\n2. **Define function signatures** - parameters, return types, and error unions\r\n3. **Implement to satisfy types** - let the compiler guide completeness\r\n4. **Validate at comptime** - catch invalid configurations during compilation\r\n\r\n### Make Illegal States Unrepresentable\r\n\r\nUse Zig's type system to prevent invalid states at compile time.\r\n\r\n**Tagged unions for mutually exclusive states:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: only valid combinations possible\r\nconst RequestState = union(enum) {\r\n    idle,\r\n    loading,\r\n    success: []const u8,\r\n    failure: anyerror,\r\n};\r\n"}}
